## Introduction

Hypervel provides an expressive, minimal API around the [Guzzle HTTP client](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/), allowing you to quickly make outgoing HTTP requests to communicate with other web applications. Hypervel's wrapper around Guzzle is focused on its most common use cases and a wonderful developer experience.

The HTTP client supports Guzzle 7 and 8.

Before sending a real request, Hypervel returns the current execution's idle database sessions to their pools. Transactions and explicitly pinned sessions remain held. Code that needs the same database session across an HTTP call may use `DB::withPinnedSession()`. See [releasing and pinning database connections](/docs/{{version}}/database#releasing-and-pinning-connections).

<a name="making-requests"></a>
## Making Requests

To make requests, you may use the `head`, `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete` methods provided by the `Http` facade. First, let's examine how to make a basic `GET` request to another URL:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

$response = Http::get('http://example.com');
```

The `get` method returns an instance of `Hypervel\Http\Client\Response`, which provides a variety of methods that may be used to inspect the response:

```php
$response->body() : string;
$response->json($key = null, $default = null, $flags = null) : mixed;
$response->object($flags = null) : mixed;
$response->collect($key = null, $flags = null) : Hypervel\Support\Collection;
$response->fluent($key = null, $flags = null) : Hypervel\Support\Fluent;
$response->decodeUsing($callback) : Hypervel\Http\Client\Response;
$response->resource() : resource;
$response->status() : int;
$response->successful() : bool;
$response->redirect(): bool;
$response->failed() : bool;
$response->clientError() : bool;
$response->header($header) : string;
$response->headers() : array;
$response->reason() : string;
$response->effectiveUri() : ?Psr\Http\Message\UriInterface;
$response->handlerStats() : array;
$response->toPsrResponse() : Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
```

You may also use the response's [tap method](/docs/{{version}}/helpers#method-tap) to inspect it without interrupting a method chain.

The `Hypervel\Http\Client\Response` object also implements the PHP `ArrayAccess` interface, allowing you to access JSON response data directly on the response:

```php
return Http::get('http://example.com/users/1')['name'];
```

The `json`, `object`, `collect`, and `fluent` methods accept an optional `flags` argument, which is passed to `json_decode`:

```php
$value = $response->json('value', flags: JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING);
```

When `flags` is omitted or `null`, these methods use `Response::$defaultJsonDecodingFlags`. You may configure this default in a service provider's `boot` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Response;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Response::$defaultJsonDecodingFlags = JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING;
}
```

The default is shared by all requests handled by the worker, so configure it only during startup. Pass `flags: 0` to use no flags for an individual call.

If you set a custom decoder using `decodeUsing`, that callback replaces JSON decoding and the flags do not apply. The callback receives the response body and a boolean indicating whether `object` was called.

In addition to the response methods listed above, the following methods may be used to determine if the response has a specific status code:

```php
$response->ok() : bool;                  // 200 OK
$response->created() : bool;             // 201 Created
$response->accepted() : bool;            // 202 Accepted
$response->noContent() : bool;           // 204 No Content
$response->movedPermanently() : bool;    // 301 Moved Permanently
$response->found() : bool;               // 302 Found
$response->notModified() : bool;         // 304 Not Modified
$response->badRequest() : bool;          // 400 Bad Request
$response->unauthorized() : bool;        // 401 Unauthorized
$response->paymentRequired() : bool;     // 402 Payment Required
$response->forbidden() : bool;           // 403 Forbidden
$response->notFound() : bool;            // 404 Not Found
$response->requestTimeout() : bool;      // 408 Request Timeout
$response->conflict() : bool;            // 409 Conflict
$response->unprocessableContent() : bool; // 422 Unprocessable Content
$response->unprocessableEntity() : bool;  // 422 Unprocessable Entity
$response->tooManyRequests() : bool;     // 429 Too Many Requests
$response->serverError() : bool;         // >= 500 Server Error
```

<a name="uri-templates"></a>
#### URI Templates

The HTTP client also allows you to construct request URLs using the [URI template specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570). To define the URL parameters that can be expanded by your URI template, you may use the `withUrlParameters` method:

```php
Http::withUrlParameters([
    'endpoint' => 'https://hypervel.org',
    'page' => 'docs',
    'version' => '13.x',
    'topic' => 'validation',
])->get('{+endpoint}/{page}/{version}/{topic}');
```

URI-template expansion is enabled only after calling `withUrlParameters`. Literal braces are otherwise treated as ordinary URL characters instead of template expressions.

<a name="dumping-requests"></a>
#### Dumping Requests

If you would like to dump the outgoing request instance before it is sent and terminate the script's execution, you may add the `dd` method to the beginning of your request definition:

```php
return Http::dd()->get('http://example.com');
```

<a name="streaming-responses"></a>
### Streaming Responses

To process a response as it arrives, you may enable the `stream` option. The `jsonLines` method allows you to iterate over newline-delimited JSON without loading the entire response into memory:

```php
$response = Http::withOptions(['stream' => true, 'read_timeout' => 30])
    ->get('https://example.com/events');

try {
    foreach ($response->jsonLines() as $event) {
        // Process the event...
    }
} finally {
    $response->close();
}
```

The `jsonLines` method skips blank lines and throws a `JsonException` if a record contains invalid JSON. Like `json`, it uses `Response::$defaultJsonDecodingFlags` unless you pass `flags`. For example, `$response->jsonLines(flags: JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING)` preserves large integers as strings. The `decodeUsing` callback applies to the whole body, not individual lines.

For plain text or a custom JSON decoder, you may use the `lines` method instead. It removes LF and CRLF line endings, preserves empty lines, and includes the final line even when it has no newline. For binary data and other formats, you may read the underlying PSR-7 response body directly.

Both methods continue reading from the body's current position. They do not rewind it. Streaming bodies cannot be rewound, so choose between processing their lines and reading the entire body with `body` or `json`. Memory usage grows with the longest line, not the total response size.

Inside a Swoole coroutine with native cURL hooks enabled, the HTTP client receives chunks as they arrive, buffers a limited amount, and pauses network reads when your application falls behind. [Named connections](#connections) reuse idle connections between requests while keeping request headers, credentials, and cookies separate. Each active stream owns its transport; concurrent streams do not multiplex onto the same connection.

For streaming requests, `timeout` bounds the wait for response headers. After headers arrive, a long-running stream may continue beyond that timeout. The `read_timeout` option limits idle gaps during headers and body reads, defaults to 60 seconds, and accepts `0` to wait without an idle limit. `connect_timeout` continues to limit connection establishment. Closing a response or canceling its consuming coroutine releases its active transfer.

If cURL negotiates authentication for a streamed request, such as digest authentication with Guzzle 7 or the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` and `CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH` cURL options, the response is returned when its first body bytes arrive or the transfer completes. The `timeout` option also covers that wait.

For streamed responses, `on_stats` runs when the response is returned. The `on_trailers` callback runs once the transfer has completed, after `on_headers`. Small responses may already be complete when returned; for longer responses, trailers arrive as the body is consumed.

Outside a hooked coroutine, or when you provide `stream_context` or a custom `stream_factory`, the client uses Guzzle's PHP-stream handler. This fallback requires `allow_url_fopen`, cannot use cURL destination pins or required transport sharing, and retains Guzzle's timeout behavior. In Guzzle 7, an omitted `read_timeout` uses the stream context or PHP socket timeout. Custom handlers and clients remain responsible for their own streaming support; faked responses do not need a transport.

<a name="request-data"></a>
### Request Data

Of course, it is common when making `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests to send additional data with your request, so these methods accept an array of data as their second argument. By default, data will be sent using the `application/json` content type:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

$response = Http::post('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Steve',
    'role' => 'Network Administrator',
]);
```

<a name="query-requests"></a>
#### QUERY Requests

You may use the `query` method to send a `QUERY` request with structured request data. By default, the data will be sent as JSON:

```php
$response = Http::query('http://example.com/search', [
    'filters' => ['status' => 'active'],
]);
```

<a name="get-request-query-parameters"></a>
#### GET Request Query Parameters

When making `GET` requests, you may either append a query string to the URL directly or pass an array of key / value pairs as the second argument to the `get` method:

```php
$response = Http::get('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Taylor',
    'page' => 1,
]);
```

Alternatively, the `withQueryParameters` method may be used:

```php
Http::retry(3, 100)->withQueryParameters([
    'name' => 'Taylor',
    'page' => 1,
])->get('http://example.com/users');
```

<a name="sending-form-url-encoded-requests"></a>
#### Sending Form URL Encoded Requests

If you would like to send data using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type, you should call the `asForm` method before making your request:

```php
$response = Http::asForm()->post('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Sara',
    'role' => 'Privacy Consultant',
]);
```

<a name="sending-a-raw-request-body"></a>
#### Sending a Raw Request Body

You may use the `withBody` method if you would like to provide a raw request body when making a request. The content type may be provided via the method's second argument:

```php
$response = Http::withBody(
    base64_encode($photo), 'image/jpeg'
)->post('http://example.com/photo');
```

If the request already provides the correct headers or should not include a content type, you may pass `null` as the second argument:

```php
$response = Http::withBody($stream, null)
    ->post('http://example.com/import');
```

<a name="multi-part-requests"></a>
#### Multi-Part Requests

If you would like to send files as multi-part requests, you should call the `attach` method before making your request. This method accepts the name of the file and its contents. If needed, you may provide a third argument which will be considered the file's filename, while a fourth argument may be used to provide headers associated with the file:

```php
$response = Http::attach(
    'attachment', file_get_contents('photo.jpg'), 'photo.jpg', ['Content-Type' => 'image/jpeg']
)->post('http://example.com/attachments');
```

Instead of passing the raw contents of a file, you may pass a stream resource:

```php
$photo = fopen('photo.jpg', 'r');

$response = Http::attach(
    'attachment', $photo, 'photo.jpg'
)->post('http://example.com/attachments');
```

<a name="headers"></a>
### Headers

Headers may be added to requests using the `withHeaders` method. This `withHeaders` method accepts an array of key / value pairs:

```php
$response = Http::withHeaders([
    'X-First' => 'foo',
    'X-Second' => 'bar'
])->post('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Taylor',
]);
```

You may use the `accept` method to specify the content type that your application is expecting in response to your request:

```php
$response = Http::accept('application/json')->get('http://example.com/users');
```

For convenience, you may use the `acceptJson` method to quickly specify that your application expects the `application/json` content type in response to your request:

```php
$response = Http::acceptJson()->get('http://example.com/users');
```

The `withHeaders` method merges new headers into the request's existing headers. If needed, you may replace values for matching header keys while retaining unrelated headers using the `replaceHeaders` method:

```php
$response = Http::withHeaders([
    'X-Original' => 'foo',
    'X-Keep' => 'bar',
])->replaceHeaders([
    'X-Original' => 'replacement',
])->post('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Taylor',
]);
```

<a name="authentication"></a>
### Authentication

You may specify basic and digest authentication credentials using the `withBasicAuth` and `withDigestAuth` methods, respectively:

```php
// Basic authentication...
$response = Http::withBasicAuth('johndoe@example.com', 'secret')->post(/* ... */);

// Digest authentication...
$response = Http::withDigestAuth('johndoe@example.com', 'secret')->post(/* ... */);
```

Built-in NTLM authentication is not provided. Integrations requiring it must supply their own authentication middleware.

<a name="bearer-tokens"></a>
#### Bearer Tokens

If you would like to quickly add a bearer token to the request's `Authorization` header, you may use the `withToken` method:

```php
$response = Http::withToken('token')->post(/* ... */);
```

<a name="request-options"></a>
### Request Options

The `withUserAgent` method may be used to specify the request's user agent:

```php
$response = Http::withUserAgent('Hypervel/1.0')->get(/* ... */);
```

You may also attach cookies to a request using the `withCookies` method:

```php
$response = Http::withCookies([
    'session' => 'abc123',
], 'example.com')->get(/* ... */);
```

To specify a cookie's path or other attributes, pass a Guzzle `SetCookie` instance to `withCookie`. The cookie must include a domain:

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Cookie\SetCookie;

$response = Http::withCookie(new SetCookie([
    'Name' => 'session',
    'Value' => 'abc123',
    'Domain' => 'api.example.com',
    'Path' => '/api',
    'Secure' => true,
    'HostOnly' => true,
]))->get('https://api.example.com/api/users');
```

By default, redirects will be followed. You may configure the maximum number of redirects using the `maxRedirects` method, or disable redirects entirely using the `withoutRedirecting` method:

```php
$response = Http::maxRedirects(3)->get(/* ... */);

$response = Http::withoutRedirecting()->get(/* ... */);
```

If you would like to disable TLS certificate verification, you may use the `withoutVerifying` method:

```php
$response = Http::withoutVerifying()->get(/* ... */);
```

The `sink` method may be used to write the response body directly to a file path or stream resource:

```php
$response = Http::sink(storage_path('app/example.txt'))->get(/* ... */);
```

<a name="timeout"></a>
### Timeout

The `timeout` method may be used to specify the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response. By default, the HTTP client will timeout after 30 seconds:

```php
$response = Http::timeout(3)->get(/* ... */);
```

If the given timeout is exceeded, an instance of `Hypervel\Http\Client\ConnectionException` will be thrown.

You may specify the maximum number of seconds to wait while trying to connect to a server using the `connectTimeout` method. The default is 10 seconds:

```php
$response = Http::connectTimeout(3)->get(/* ... */);
```

<a name="retries"></a>
### Retries

If you would like the HTTP client to automatically retry the request if a client or server error occurs, you may use the `retry` method. The `retry` method accepts the maximum number of times the request should be attempted and the number of milliseconds that Hypervel should wait in between attempts:

```php
$response = Http::retry(3, 100)->post(/* ... */);
```

If you would like to manually calculate the number of milliseconds to sleep between attempts, you may pass a closure as the second argument to the `retry` method:

```php
use Throwable;

$response = Http::retry(3, function (int $attempt, Throwable $exception) {
    return $attempt * 100;
})->post(/* ... */);
```

For convenience, you may also provide an array as the first argument to the `retry` method. This array will be used to determine how many milliseconds to sleep between subsequent attempts:

```php
$response = Http::retry([100, 200])->post(/* ... */);
```

If needed, you may pass a third argument to the `retry` method. The third argument should be a callable that determines if the retries should actually be attempted. For example, you may wish to only retry the request if the initial request encounters a `ConnectionException`:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\ConnectionException;
use Hypervel\Http\Client\PendingRequest;
use Throwable;

$response = Http::retry(3, 100, function (?Throwable $exception, PendingRequest $request) {
    return $exception instanceof ConnectionException;
})->post(/* ... */);
```

The callback also receives the HTTP method as a third argument, or `null` when the method is unavailable.

If a request attempt fails, you may wish to make a change to the request before a new attempt is made. You can achieve this by modifying the request argument provided to the callable you provided to the `retry` method. For example, you might want to retry the request with a new authorization token if the first attempt returned an authentication error:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\PendingRequest;
use Hypervel\Http\Client\RequestException;
use Throwable;

$response = Http::withToken($this->getToken())->retry(2, 0, function (?Throwable $exception, PendingRequest $request) {
    if (! $exception instanceof RequestException || $exception->response->status() !== 401) {
        return false;
    }

    $request->withToken($this->getNewToken());

    return true;
})->post(/* ... */);
```

If all of the requests fail, an instance of `Hypervel\Http\Client\RequestException` will be thrown. If you would like to disable this behavior, you may provide a `throw` argument with a value of `false`. When disabled, the last response received by the client will be returned after all retries have been attempted:

```php
$response = Http::retry(3, 100, throw: false)->post(/* ... */);
```

> [!WARNING]
> If all of the requests fail because of a connection issue, a `Hypervel\Http\Client\ConnectionException` will still be thrown even when the `throw` argument is set to `false`.

<a name="error-handling"></a>
### Error Handling

Unlike Guzzle's default behavior, Hypervel's HTTP client wrapper does not throw exceptions on client or server errors (`400` and `500` level responses from servers). You may determine if one of these errors was returned using the `successful`, `clientError`, or `serverError` methods:

```php
// Determine if the status code is >= 200 and < 300...
$response->successful();

// Determine if the status code is >= 400...
$response->failed();

// Determine if the response has a 400 level status code...
$response->clientError();

// Determine if the response has a 500 level status code...
$response->serverError();

// Immediately execute the given callback if there was a client or server error...
$response->onError(callable $callback);
```

<a name="throwing-exceptions"></a>
#### Throwing Exceptions

If you have a response instance and would like to throw an instance of `Hypervel\Http\Client\RequestException` if the response status code indicates a client or server error, you may use the `throw` or `throwIf` methods:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Response;

$response = Http::post(/* ... */);

// Throw an exception if a client or server error occurred...
$response->throw();

// Throw an exception if an error occurred and the given condition is true...
$response->throwIf($condition);

// Throw an exception if an error occurred and the given closure resolves to true...
$response->throwIf(fn (Response $response) => true);

// Throw an exception if an error occurred and the given condition is false...
$response->throwUnless($condition);

// Throw an exception if an error occurred and the given closure resolves to false...
$response->throwUnless(fn (Response $response) => false);

// Throw an exception if the response has a specific status code...
$response->throwIfStatus(403);

// Throw an exception unless the response has a specific status code...
$response->throwUnlessStatus(200);

// Throw an exception if a server error occurred (status >= 500)...
$response->throwIfServerError();

// Throw an exception if a client error occurred (status >= 400 and < 500)...
$response->throwIfClientError();

return $response['user']['id'];
```

The `Hypervel\Http\Client\RequestException` instance has a public `$response` property which will allow you to inspect the returned response.

The `throw` method returns the response instance if no error occurred, allowing you to chain other operations onto the `throw` method:

```php
return Http::post(/* ... */)->throw()->json();
```

If you would like to perform some additional logic before the exception is thrown, you may pass a closure to the `throw` method. The exception will be thrown automatically after the closure is invoked, so you do not need to re-throw the exception from within the closure:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Response;
use Hypervel\Http\Client\RequestException;

return Http::post(/* ... */)->throw(function (Response $response, RequestException $e) {
    // ...
})->json();
```

By default, `RequestException` messages are truncated to 120 characters when logged or reported. To customize or disable this behavior, you may utilize the `truncateAt` and `dontTruncate` methods when configuring your application's registered behavior in your `bootstrap/app.php` file:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\RequestException;

->registered(function (): void {
    // Truncate request exception messages to 240 characters...
    RequestException::truncateAt(240);

    // Disable request exception message truncation...
    RequestException::dontTruncate();
})
```

Alternatively, you may customize the exception truncation behavior per request using the `truncateExceptionsAt` method:

```php
return Http::truncateExceptionsAt(240)->post(/* ... */);
```

<a name="guzzle-middleware"></a>
### Guzzle Middleware

Since Hypervel's HTTP client is powered by Guzzle, you may take advantage of [Guzzle Middleware](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/handlers-and-middleware.html) to manipulate the outgoing request or inspect the incoming response. To manipulate the outgoing request, register a Guzzle middleware via the `withRequestMiddleware` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;
use Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface;

$response = Http::withRequestMiddleware(
    function (RequestInterface $request) {
        return $request->withHeader('X-Example', 'Value');
    }
)->get('http://example.com');
```

Likewise, you can inspect the incoming HTTP response by registering a middleware via the `withResponseMiddleware` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

$response = Http::withResponseMiddleware(
    function (ResponseInterface $response) {
        $header = $response->getHeader('X-Example');

        // ...

        return $response;
    }
)->get('http://example.com');
```

The `withMiddleware` method appends a complete Guzzle middleware callable to the pending request. If an integration must run before all existing middleware, including global middleware, use `prependMiddleware`:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

$traceId = 'request-id';

$response = Http::prependMiddleware(
    fn (callable $handler) => fn ($request, array $options) => $handler(
        $request->withHeader('X-Trace-ID', $traceId),
        $options,
    )
)->get('http://example.com');
```

<a name="global-middleware"></a>
#### Global Middleware

Sometimes, you may want to register a middleware that applies to every outgoing request and incoming response. To accomplish this, you may use the `globalRequestMiddleware` and `globalResponseMiddleware` methods. Typically, these methods should be invoked in the `boot` method of your application's `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

Http::globalRequestMiddleware(fn ($request) => $request->withHeader(
    'User-Agent', 'Example Application/1.0'
));

Http::globalResponseMiddleware(fn ($response) => $response->withHeader(
    'X-Finished-At', now()->toDateTimeString()
));
```

Global middleware remains active for the lifetime of the worker, so it should be registered during application boot rather than request handling.

<a name="request-callbacks"></a>
### Request Callbacks

You may register a callback that is invoked before a request is sent using the `beforeSending` method. The callback receives the outgoing request, the request options, and the pending request instance:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\PendingRequest;
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Request;

$response = Http::beforeSending(function (Request $request, array $options, PendingRequest $pendingRequest) {
    // ...
})->get('http://example.com');
```

Likewise, you may register a callback that is invoked after a response is received using the `afterResponse` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Response;

$response = Http::afterResponse(function (Response $response) {
    // ...

    return $response;
})->get('http://example.com');
```

<a name="guzzle-options"></a>
### Guzzle Options

You may specify additional [Guzzle request options](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/request-options.html) for an outgoing request using the `withOptions` method. The `withOptions` method accepts an array of key / value pairs:

```php
$response = Http::withOptions([
    'debug' => true,
])->get('http://example.com/users');
```

<a name="global-options"></a>
#### Global Options

To configure default options for every outgoing request, you may utilize the `globalOptions` method. Typically, this method should be invoked from the `boot` method of your application's `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Http::globalOptions([
        'allow_redirects' => false,
    ]);
}
```

Global options remain active for the lifetime of the worker, so they should not be changed during request handling.

To create requests without global options or middleware, use the `withoutGlobalConfiguration` method. HTTP fakes and stray-request protection still apply:

```php
$response = Http::withoutGlobalConfiguration(
    fn () => Http::get('https://example.com/users')
);
```

The callback affects only the current coroutine. For parallel requests, call `withoutGlobalConfiguration` inside each task.

<a name="telescope-recording"></a>
### Telescope Recording

If your application uses [Telescope](/docs/{{version}}/telescope), HTTP client requests are automatically recorded by the HTTP client watcher. You may exclude an individual request from being recorded by chaining the `withoutTelescope` method:

```php
$response = Http::withoutTelescope()->get('http://example.com');
```

To attach tags to a recorded request — for example, to identify which downstream service or feature initiated the call — use the `withTelescopeTags` method. You can pass raw strings, or enum cases:

```php
$response = Http::withTelescopeTags(['billing', 'stripe'])->get('http://example.com');
```

```php
enum BillingTag: string
{
    case Billing = 'billing';
    case Stripe = 'stripe';
}

$response = Http::withTelescopeTags([BillingTag::Billing, BillingTag::Stripe])
    ->get('http://example.com');
```

Enum cases are normalized to strings before storage — backed enums use their `->value`, unit enums use their `->name`.

These methods are safe to call regardless of Telescope's state. They simply set Guzzle option keys that the Telescope watcher reads when present; if Telescope is disabled or not installed, the keys are ignored and the request runs as normal with no overhead.

<a name="opentelemetry-tracing"></a>
### OpenTelemetry Tracing

When [OpenTelemetry](/docs/{{version}}/opentelemetry#http) tracing is enabled, outgoing requests are traced automatically and send the current trace context to the server they call. You may skip tracing a request using the `withoutTrace` method, or keep the trace without automatically adding trace headers using the `withoutTracePropagation` method. This method leaves any headers you supplied yourself unchanged. Use `withoutTracePropagation` for third-party and customer-supplied URLs, which should not receive your internal trace identifiers:

```php
$response = Http::withoutTracePropagation()->post($webhookUrl, $payload);
```

Like the Telescope methods, these methods are safe to call whether or not OpenTelemetry is installed or enabled.

<a name="concurrent-requests"></a>
## Concurrent Requests

Sometimes, you may wish to make multiple HTTP requests concurrently. In other words, you want several requests to be dispatched at the same time instead of issuing the requests sequentially. This can lead to substantial performance improvements when interacting with slow HTTP APIs.

<a name="dispatching-concurrent-requests"></a>
### Dispatching Concurrent Requests

In Hypervel, the simplest way to dispatch multiple HTTP requests concurrently is the `parallel` helper from `Hypervel\Coroutine`. It accepts an array of closures, runs each in its own coroutine, and returns the results once all of them have completed:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$responses = parallel([
    fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/first'),
    fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/second'),
    fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/third'),
]);

return $responses[0]->ok() &&
       $responses[1]->ok() &&
       $responses[2]->ok();
```

If the parent coroutine has already used the database, call `DB::releaseIdleConnections()` before `parallel()` to make its idle sessions available while it waits. The HTTP requests run in child coroutines and cannot release the parent's connections. Transactions and pinned sessions still remain held; see [database connection pooling](/docs/{{version}}/database#releasing-and-pinning-connections).

Each response can be accessed based on the order it was added to the array. If you wish, you can name the requests using array keys, which allows you to access the corresponding responses by name:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$responses = parallel([
    'first' => fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/first'),
    'second' => fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/second'),
    'third' => fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/third'),
]);

return $responses['first']->ok();
```

Each closure may use the full `Http` API, including chained methods like `withHeaders`, `withToken`, and `timeout`:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$responses = parallel([
    fn () => Http::withToken($token)->get('http://localhost/first'),
    fn () => Http::withHeaders(['X-Trace' => $id])->get('http://localhost/second'),
]);
```

<a name="limiting-concurrency"></a>
### Limiting Concurrency

By default, `parallel` dispatches every closure simultaneously. If you need to cap how many requests are in flight at once — for example, to avoid overwhelming a downstream service — pass a maximum to the second argument:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$responses = parallel([
    fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/first'),
    fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/second'),
    // ...
], concurrent: 5);
```

For finer control — such as collecting partial results when some requests fail without throwing — instantiate `Parallel` directly and call `wait(throw: false)`. After the call, the returned array holds the successful results, and the failures may be inspected via `getThrowables()`, `hasFailures()`, and `failedCount()` on the same instance:

```php
use Hypervel\Coroutine\Parallel;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

$parallel = new Parallel(concurrent: 5);

foreach ($urls as $key => $url) {
    $parallel->add(fn () => Http::get($url), $key);
}

$results = $parallel->wait(throw: false);

if ($parallel->hasFailures()) {
    foreach ($parallel->getThrowables() as $key => $error) {
        $logger->error('Request failed', ['key' => $key, 'error' => $error->getMessage()]);
    }
}
```

<a name="handling-failures"></a>
### Handling Failures

When you dispatch concurrent requests with `parallel`, any closure may throw — typically a `ConnectionException` for a network failure, or a `RequestException` raised by calling `throw()` on the response. If at least one closure throws, `parallel` collects every failure and throws a single `Hypervel\Coroutine\Exceptions\ParallelExecutionException`. The exception exposes the successful results via `getResults()` and the failures via `getThrowables()`, both keyed by your closure keys:

```php
use Hypervel\Coroutine\Exceptions\ParallelExecutionException;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

try {
    $responses = parallel([
        'github' => fn () => Http::get('https://api.github.com/user'),
        'gitlab' => fn () => Http::get('https://gitlab.com/api/v4/user'),
    ]);
} catch (ParallelExecutionException $e) {
    foreach ($e->getThrowables() as $key => $error) {
        $logger->error('Request failed', ['key' => $key, 'error' => $error->getMessage()]);
    }

    // Successful responses from the same call are still available...
    $partial = $e->getResults();
}
```

If you would rather always receive partial results without an exception being thrown, instantiate `Parallel` directly and call `wait(throw: false)`. The non-throwing path exposes failures via `getThrowables()` / `hasFailures()` / `failedCount()` on the `Parallel` instance, as shown in [Limiting Concurrency](#limiting-concurrency).

<a name="per-request-callbacks"></a>
### Per-Request Callbacks

To run logic as each individual request completes — for example, to log progress or update a counter — place that logic at the end of the closure for that request:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$responses = parallel([
    'github' => function () use ($logger) {
        $response = Http::get('https://api.github.com/user');
        $logger->info('Completed', ['key' => 'github', 'status' => $response->status()]);
        return $response;
    },
    'gitlab' => function () use ($logger) {
        $response = Http::get('https://gitlab.com/api/v4/user');
        $logger->info('Completed', ['key' => 'gitlab', 'status' => $response->status()]);
        return $response;
    },
]);
```

If the same logic should run after every request completes, factor it out into a wrapper closure that takes the request key and the underlying request callable:

```php
use Closure;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$track = fn (string $key, Closure $request) => function () use ($key, $request, $logger) {
    $response = $request();
    $logger->info('Completed', ['key' => $key, 'status' => $response->status()]);
    return $response;
};

$responses = parallel([
    'github' => $track('github', fn () => Http::get('https://api.github.com/user')),
    'gitlab' => $track('gitlab', fn () => Http::get('https://gitlab.com/api/v4/user')),
]);
```

<a name="running-concurrent-requests-after-the-response"></a>
### Running Concurrent Requests After the Response

To dispatch a batch of HTTP requests after the current HTTP response has been sent to the user, wrap the call in Hypervel's `defer` helper. This keeps the response feeling fast while the requests run in the background:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

defer(function () {
    parallel([
        fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/first'),
        fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/second'),
        fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/third'),
    ]);
});
```

By default, deferred callbacks only run when the response is successful (a status code below 400). If you want the requests to run even when the response indicates an error, chain the `always` method:

```php
defer(function () {
    parallel([
        fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/first'),
        fn () => Http::get('http://localhost/second'),
    ]);
})->always();
```

<a name="guzzle-promises"></a>
### Guzzle Promises

When using Guzzle's asynchronous APIs directly, create and finish each operation in the same coroutine. This keeps its callbacks, request context, and database transactions together. For example, create the client and wait for its response inside each parallel task:

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$responses = parallel([
    fn () => (new Client)->getAsync('https://example.com/users')->wait(),
    fn () => (new Client)->getAsync('https://example.com/orders')->wait(),
]);
```

Hypervel throws a `Hypervel\Http\Exceptions\CoroutineOwnershipException` if another coroutine tries to use a pending Guzzle promise or drive a cURL multi-handler with active work. Completed results may be shared. When a coroutine exits, Hypervel cancels its unfinished native transfers and runs its queued callbacks in that same coroutine, allowing cancellation to reach dependent promises. Finish any work you need before returning from the coroutine.

These checks apply to Guzzle's mutable promises and cURL multi-handlers, including those used by third-party SDKs. Custom transports and other promise implementations remain responsible for their own coroutine safety. When supplying a custom handler, keep each active multi-handler within one coroutine. Once all its transfers finish, it may be reused by another coroutine.

<a name="connections"></a>
## Connections

Hypervel's HTTP client supports named connection presets for services your application calls frequently. Synchronous requests on a registered connection share one low-level Guzzle transport handler, which retains reusable cURL handles and keep-alive connection state. Every pending request still receives a fresh Guzzle client and middleware stack, so request-specific middleware, callbacks, and options never become frozen onto the first request. Asynchronous requests use isolated handlers because a worker-lived cURL multi-handler cannot be driven safely by concurrent coroutines. These handlers still use the connection's registered transport sharing and multiplexing settings.

For streamed responses, each named connection keeps up to 32 idle connections per worker for reuse. Connections are opened as needed; this does not limit how many requests can run at once.

To register a connection, typically in the `boot` method of your application's `AppServiceProvider`, call the `registerConnection` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Http::registerConnection('github', [
        'base_uri' => 'https://api.github.com',
        'timeout' => 10,
        'headers' => [
            'Accept' => 'application/vnd.github+json',
        ],
    ]);
}
```

The second argument is a request-option preset. It accepts normal Guzzle request options except for options whose ownership belongs to a dedicated Hypervel API:

- `cookies` is rejected. Every pending request owns an isolated cookie jar; add cookies using `withCookie()` or `withCookies()`.
- `handler` is rejected. Use `setHandler()` for a request-specific handler.
- `pool` is rejected. HTTP clients are not object-pooled.
- `max_host_connections` and `max_total_connections` are rejected. Use bounded coroutine fan-out or the rate limiter instead.
- `transport_sharing` configures the connection's shared and isolated handlers. It accepts Guzzle's `TransportSharing` modes and is never passed into request options.
- `max_idle_handles` sets how many idle cURL handles the connection's synchronous buffered transport keeps for its next requests (256 by default; 0 keeps none). Each handle holds its own keep-alive connections, allowing requests from concurrent coroutines to reuse them. It does not limit concurrent requests or open sockets: handles in use are additional, and Guzzle's persistent transport sharing keeps connections in its share instead. Streamed responses use the separate retention limit described above.
- `multiplex` remains a request option. The `Multiplexing::NONE` mode also configures the connection handler so its guarantee applies to every request using that handler.

The dedicated connection-cap options are rejected at every option layer. `pool`, `handler`, `cookies`, `transport_sharing`, and `max_idle_handles` are also rejected from global options, per-call connection overrides, fluent `withOptions()` calls, and raw `send()` options. This keeps cookie and handler ownership consistent regardless of which option layer supplied a value.

Once registered, select a connection for a request by chaining the `connection` method:

```php
$response = Http::connection('github')
    ->withToken($token)
    ->get('/user');
```

Option precedence is deterministic and does not depend on chaining order: factory global options are the lowest layer, followed by the registered connection preset, an optional per-call connection override, and finally fluent request options. Passing an empty per-call array intentionally clears the registered request preset. The connection's handler settings remain unchanged:

```php
// Uses the registered GitHub preset...
Http::connection('github')->get('/user');

// Replaces the preset with an empty option layer for this request...
Http::connection('github', [])->get('https://example.com');
```

`setHandler()` replaces only the low-level handler beneath that request's fresh middleware stack; its global, connection, and fluent options still apply. `setClient()` gives the caller complete ownership of the client and bypasses the connection preset. Global and fluent request options still apply to the request sent through that client.

Each pending request constructs one cookie jar and reuses it only across that request's redirects and retry attempts. Concurrent requests never share cookies. Requests made without `connection()` use their own default low-level handler and the same per-request cookie behavior.

Calling `registerConnection()` or `setConnectionConfig()` again invalidates the connection's cached low-level handler. Subsequent requests lazily create a handler from the new configuration, while in-flight requests safely finish on their existing handler reference.

<a name="restricting-destinations"></a>
## Restricting Destinations

When your application sends requests to URLs supplied by its users, such as webhook endpoints, link previews, or file imports, a malicious URL could point the request at your internal network, a cloud metadata service, or another private address. To prevent this, pass a destination policy to the `withDestinationPolicy` method. The `PublicDestinationPolicy` only allows public addresses:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Destinations\PublicDestinationPolicy;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

$response = Http::withDestinationPolicy(new PublicDestinationPolicy)
    ->post($webhookUrl, $payload);
```

The policy resolves the destination's hostname, rejects the request if any of its addresses are private or reserved, and then connects only to the addresses it checked. Since the connection is pinned to those addresses, a hostname whose DNS answer changes after the check cannot send the request somewhere else. Each redirect is checked the same way before it is followed.

If a destination is not allowed, a `Hypervel\Http\Client\Destinations\DisallowedDestinationException` is thrown, and the request is never retried. If the destination's hostname cannot be resolved, a `Hypervel\Http\Client\Destinations\DestinationResolutionException` is thrown instead. It extends `ConnectionException`, so it is reported like any other connection failure and retried when you configure retries using `retry()`. The time spent resolving the hostname counts against the request's timeout and connect timeout.

<a name="validating-destination-urls"></a>
### Validating URLs

You may check a URL before storing it, such as when a user saves a webhook endpoint, using the policy's `validate` method. It throws a `DisallowedDestinationException` for a URL the policy would never send to, including a private address written as an IP address. Hostnames are not resolved, since their addresses may change before a request is sent; each request checks them when it resolves them:

```php
(new PublicDestinationPolicy)->validate($request->input('url'));
```

<a name="allowing-internal-networks"></a>
### Allowing Internal Networks

During local development, or when some known internal services should be reachable, you may allow specific addresses or CIDR ranges:

```php
$policy = new PublicDestinationPolicy(allowedNetworks: ['10.20.0.0/16']);
```

For more specific rules, you may extend `PublicDestinationPolicy` and override its `allowsAddress` method, which receives the destination URI and each address it resolved to. You may also write a policy of your own by implementing the `Hypervel\Http\Client\Destinations\DestinationPolicy` interface.

<a name="egress-proxies"></a>
### Egress Proxies

To send restricted requests through an egress proxy, extend the policy and return the proxy's URL from its `proxyFor` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Destinations\PublicDestinationPolicy;
use Psr\Http\Message\UriInterface;

class EgressProxyPolicy extends PublicDestinationPolicy
{
    protected function proxyFor(UriInterface $uri): ?string
    {
        return 'http://egress-proxy.internal:4750';
    }
}
```

A proxy URL without a port uses its scheme's default port: 80 for `http` and 443 for `https`. The policy then checks and pins the proxy's address instead of the destination's. Since proxies usually run on private addresses, allow the proxy's address using `allowedNetworks` or `allowsAddress`. Destinations written as IP addresses are still checked, but hostnames are resolved by the proxy, so the proxy itself must refuse private destinations. A filtering egress proxy such as [Smokescreen](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen) does this.

If the proxy cannot be resolved or refuses the connection, a `Hypervel\Http\Client\Destinations\ProxyConnectionException` is thrown. It extends `ConnectionException`, and lets you tell a failure of your own egress path apart from a failure of the destination.

<a name="destination-policy-limitations"></a>
### Limitations

Pinning relies on Guzzle's cURL transport and libcurl 7.75 or newer. Streaming is supported inside a Swoole coroutine with native cURL hooks enabled. Restricted requests may not use the PHP-stream fallback, set their own `proxy` or raw `curl` options, or use a custom handler from the `setHandler` method; such requests throw a `DisallowedDestinationException`. To write a large response directly to a file, use the `sink` method.

If the installed cURL transport lacks a required capability, a `Hypervel\Http\Client\Destinations\DestinationPolicyException` is thrown. These failures are never retried, and your retry callback is not called, because another attempt cannot change the installed transport.

A client supplied using the `setClient` method owns its whole handler stack, so the policy does not apply to its requests. Faked requests never reach the policy either, so `Http::fake()` works as usual in your tests.

If you extend the HTTP client factory to replace its connection handler, your transport must honor the policy's cURL pinning options. A transport that ignores those options bypasses destination enforcement.

<a name="macros"></a>
## Macros

The Hypervel HTTP client allows you to define "macros", which can serve as a fluent, expressive mechanism to configure common request paths and headers when interacting with services throughout your application. To get started, you may define the macro within the `boot` method of your application's `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` class:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Http::macro('github', function () {
        return Http::withHeaders([
            'X-Example' => 'example',
        ])->baseUrl('https://github.com');
    });
}
```

Once your macro has been configured, you may invoke it from anywhere in your application to create a pending request with the specified configuration:

```php
$response = Http::github()->get('/');
```

Macros are stored globally for the life of the PHP process. Hypervel automatically flushes framework-owned HTTP client macros after every test. If your application or package defines its own macroable class, add it to your [test-state cleanup](/docs/{{version}}/testing#macro-state).

<a name="testing"></a>
## Testing

Many Hypervel services provide functionality to help you easily and expressively write tests, and Hypervel's HTTP client is no exception. The `Http` facade's `fake` method allows you to instruct the HTTP client to return stubbed / dummy responses when requests are made.

<a name="faking-responses"></a>
### Faking Responses

For example, to instruct the HTTP client to return empty, `200` status code responses for every request, you may call the `fake` method with no arguments:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

Http::fake();

$response = Http::post(/* ... */);
```

<a name="faking-specific-urls"></a>
#### Faking Specific URLs

Alternatively, you may pass an array to the `fake` method. The array's keys should represent URL patterns that you wish to fake and their associated responses. The `*` character may be used as a wildcard character. You may use the `Http` facade's `response` method to construct stub / fake responses for these endpoints:

```php
Http::fake([
    // Stub a JSON response for GitHub endpoints...
    'github.com/*' => Http::response(['foo' => 'bar'], 200, $headers),

    // Stub a string response for Google endpoints...
    'google.com/*' => Http::response('Hello World', 200, $headers),
]);
```

Any requests made to URLs that have not been faked will actually be executed. If you would like to specify a fallback URL pattern that will stub all unmatched URLs, you may use a single `*` character:

```php
Http::fake([
    // Stub a JSON response for GitHub endpoints...
    'github.com/*' => Http::response(['foo' => 'bar'], 200, ['Headers']),

    // Stub a string response for all other endpoints...
    '*' => Http::response('Hello World', 200, ['Headers']),
]);
```

For convenience, simple string, JSON, and empty responses may be generated by providing a string, array, or integer as the response:

```php
Http::fake([
    'google.com/*' => 'Hello World',
    'github.com/*' => ['foo' => 'bar'],
    'chatgpt.com/*' => 200,
]);
```

Fake response bodies may also be PHP stream resources or PSR-7 stream instances:

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Utils;

Http::fake([
    'example.com/*' => Http::response(Utils::streamFor('Hello World')),
]);
```

<a name="faking-connection-exceptions"></a>
#### Faking Exceptions

Sometimes you may need to test your application's behavior if the HTTP client encounters a `Hypervel\Http\Client\ConnectionException` when attempting to make a request. You can instruct the HTTP client to throw a connection exception using the `failedConnection` method:

```php
Http::fake([
    'github.com/*' => Http::failedConnection(),
]);
```

To test your application's behavior if a `Hypervel\Http\Client\RequestException` is thrown, you may use the `failedRequest` method:

```php
$this->mock(GithubService::class)
    ->shouldReceive('getUser')
    ->andThrow(Http::failedRequest(['code' => 'not_found'], 404));
```

<a name="faking-response-sequences"></a>
#### Faking Response Sequences

Sometimes you may need to specify that a single URL should return a series of fake responses in a specific order. You may accomplish this using the `Http::sequence` method to build the responses:

```php
Http::fake([
    // Stub a series of responses for GitHub endpoints...
    'github.com/*' => Http::sequence()
        ->push('Hello World', 200)
        ->push(['foo' => 'bar'], 200)
        ->pushStatus(404),
]);
```

The `push` method accepts the same response bodies as `Http::response`, including PHP stream resources and PSR-7 streams.

When all the responses in a response sequence have been consumed, any further requests will cause the response sequence to throw an exception. If you would like to specify a default response that should be returned when a sequence is empty, you may use the `whenEmpty` method:

```php
Http::fake([
    // Stub a series of responses for GitHub endpoints...
    'github.com/*' => Http::sequence()
        ->push('Hello World', 200)
        ->push(['foo' => 'bar'], 200)
        ->whenEmpty(Http::response()),
]);
```

If you would like to fake a sequence of responses but do not need to specify a specific URL pattern that should be faked, you may use the `Http::fakeSequence` method:

```php
Http::fakeSequence()
    ->push('Hello World', 200)
    ->whenEmpty(Http::response());
```

<a name="fake-callback"></a>
#### Fake Callback

If you require more complicated logic to determine what responses to return for certain endpoints, you may pass a closure to the `fake` method. This closure will receive an instance of `Hypervel\Http\Client\Request` and should return a response instance. Within your closure, you may perform whatever logic is necessary to determine what type of response to return:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Request;

Http::fake(function (Request $request) {
    return Http::response('Hello World', 200);
});
```

<a name="request-attributes"></a>
#### Request Attributes

To distinguish requests sent to the same URL, you may attach attributes using the `withAttributes` method. These attributes are available to fake callbacks and request assertions through the request's `attributes` method and are not sent to the remote server:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

Http::fake(fn (Request $request) => match ($request->attributes()['name'] ?? null) {
    'products' => Http::response(['products' => []]),
    default => Http::response(),
});

$response = Http::withAttributes(['name' => 'products'])
    ->get('https://example.com/graphql');
```

<a name="inspecting-requests"></a>
### Inspecting Requests

When faking responses, you may occasionally wish to inspect the requests the client receives in order to make sure your application is sending the correct data or headers. You may accomplish this by calling the `Http::assertSent` method after calling `Http::fake`.

If a test makes real requests, call `Http::record()` before sending them to enable the same request assertions without faking their responses.

The `assertSent` method accepts a closure which will receive a `Hypervel\Http\Client\Request` instance and should return a boolean value indicating if the request matches your expectations. In order for the test to pass, at least one request must have been issued matching the given expectations:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

Http::fake();

Http::withHeaders([
    'X-First' => 'foo',
])->post('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Taylor',
    'role' => 'Developer',
]);

Http::assertSent(function (Request $request) {
    return $request->hasHeader('X-First', 'foo') &&
           $request->url() === 'http://example.com/users' &&
           $request['name'] === 'Taylor' &&
           $request['role'] === 'Developer';
});
```

The `Hypervel\Http\Client\Request` instance provides a variety of methods that may be used to inspect the request, including `method`, `url`, `uri`, `headers`, `body`, `data`, `query`, `hasFile`, `isJson`, `isForm`, and `isMultipart`.

If needed, you may assert that a specific request was not sent using the `assertNotSent` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

Http::fake();

Http::post('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Taylor',
    'role' => 'Developer',
]);

Http::assertNotSent(function (Request $request) {
    return $request->url() === 'http://example.com/posts';
});
```

You may use the `assertSentCount` method to assert how many requests were "sent" during the test:

```php
Http::fake();

Http::assertSentCount(5);
```

You may use the `assertSentInOrder` method to assert that requests were sent in a given order:

```php
Http::fake();

Http::get('https://hypervel.org');
Http::get('https://api.hypervel.org');

Http::assertSentInOrder([
    'https://hypervel.org',
    'https://api.hypervel.org',
]);
```

Or, you may use the `assertNothingSent` method to assert that no requests were sent during the test:

```php
Http::fake();

Http::assertNothingSent();
```

If your test uses response sequences, you may use the `assertSequencesAreEmpty` method to assert that every created response sequence has been fully consumed:

```php
Http::fake([
    'github.com/*' => Http::sequence()
        ->push('Hello World', 200),
]);

Http::get('https://github.com/hypervel/hypervel');

Http::assertSequencesAreEmpty();
```

#### Recording Requests / Responses

You may use the `recorded` method to gather all requests and their corresponding responses. The `recorded` method returns a collection of arrays that contains instances of `Hypervel\Http\Client\Request` and `Hypervel\Http\Client\Response`:

```php
Http::fake([
    'https://hypervel.org' => Http::response(status: 500),
    'https://api.hypervel.org/' => Http::response(),
]);

Http::get('https://hypervel.org');
Http::get('https://api.hypervel.org/');

$recorded = Http::recorded();

[$request, $response] = $recorded[0];
```

Additionally, the `recorded` method accepts a closure which will receive an instance of `Hypervel\Http\Client\Request` and `Hypervel\Http\Client\Response` and may be used to filter request / response pairs based on your expectations:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Request;
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Response;

Http::fake([
    'https://hypervel.org' => Http::response(status: 500),
    'https://api.hypervel.org/' => Http::response(),
]);

Http::get('https://hypervel.org');
Http::get('https://api.hypervel.org/');

$recorded = Http::recorded(function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    return $request->url() !== 'https://hypervel.org' &&
           $response->successful();
});
```

### Preventing Stray Requests

If you would like to ensure that all requests sent via the HTTP client have been faked throughout your individual test or complete test suite, you can call the `preventStrayRequests` method. After calling this method, any requests that do not have a corresponding fake response will throw an exception rather than making the actual HTTP request:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

Http::preventStrayRequests();

Http::fake([
    'github.com/*' => Http::response('ok'),
]);

// An "ok" response is returned...
Http::get('https://github.com/hypervel/hypervel');

// An exception is thrown...
Http::get('https://hypervel.org');
```

Sometimes, you may wish to prevent most stray requests while still allowing specific requests to execute. To accomplish this, you may pass an array of URL patterns to the `allowStrayRequests` method. Any request matching one of the given patterns will be allowed, while all other requests will continue to throw an exception:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

Http::preventStrayRequests();

Http::allowStrayRequests([
    'http://127.0.0.1:5000/*',
]);

// This request is executed...
Http::get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate');

// An exception is thrown...
Http::get('https://hypervel.org');
```

<a name="events"></a>
## Events

Hypervel fires three events during the process of sending HTTP requests. The `RequestSending` event is fired prior to a request being sent, while the `ResponseReceived` event is fired after a response is received for a given request. The `ConnectionFailed` event is fired if no response is received for a given request.

The `RequestSending` and `ConnectionFailed` events both contain a public `$request` property that you may use to inspect the `Hypervel\Http\Client\Request` instance. Likewise, the `ResponseReceived` event contains a `$request` property as well as a `$response` property which may be used to inspect the `Hypervel\Http\Client\Response` instance. You may create [event listeners](/docs/{{version}}/events) for these events within your application:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Client\Events\RequestSending;

class LogRequest
{
    /**
     * Handle the event.
     */
    public function handle(RequestSending $event): void
    {
        // $event->request ...
    }
}
```
