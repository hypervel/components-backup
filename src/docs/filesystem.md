## Introduction

Hypervel provides a powerful filesystem abstraction thanks to the wonderful [Flysystem](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem) PHP package by Frank de Jonge. The Hypervel Flysystem integration provides simple drivers for working with local filesystems, FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3, and Google Cloud Storage. Even better, it's amazingly simple to switch between these storage options between your local development machine and production server as the API remains the same for each system.

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

Hypervel's filesystem configuration file is located at `config/filesystems.php`. Within this file, you may configure all of your filesystem "disks". Each disk represents a particular storage driver and storage location. Example configurations for each supported driver are included in the configuration file so you can modify the configuration to reflect your storage preferences and credentials.

The `local` driver interacts with files stored locally on the server running the Hypervel application, while the `ftp` and `sftp` storage drivers are used for FTP and SFTP. The `s3` and `gcs` drivers are used to write to Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

> [!NOTE]
> You may configure as many disks as you like and may even have multiple disks that use the same driver.

<a name="the-local-driver"></a>
### The Local Driver

When using the `local` driver, all file operations are relative to the `root` directory defined in your `filesystems` configuration file. By default, this value is set to the `storage/app/private` directory. Therefore, the following method would write to `storage/app/private/example.txt`:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::disk('local')->put('example.txt', 'Contents');
```

<a name="the-public-disk"></a>
### The Public Disk

The `public` disk included in your application's `filesystems` configuration file is intended for files that are going to be publicly accessible. By default, the `public` disk uses the `local` driver and stores its files in `storage/app/public`.

If your `public` disk uses the `local` driver and you want to make these files accessible from the web, you should create a symbolic link from source directory `storage/app/public` to target directory `public/storage`:

To create the symbolic link, you may use the `storage:link` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan storage:link
```

Once a file has been stored and the symbolic link has been created, you can create a URL to the files using the `asset` helper:

```php
echo asset('storage/file.txt');
```

You may configure additional symbolic links in your `filesystems` configuration file. Each of the configured links will be created when you run the `storage:link` command:

```php
'links' => [
    public_path('storage') => storage_path('app/public'),
    public_path('images') => storage_path('app/images'),
],
```

The `storage:unlink` command may be used to destroy your configured symbolic links:

```shell
php artisan storage:unlink
```

<a name="driver-prerequisites"></a>
### Driver Prerequisites

<a name="s3-driver-configuration"></a>
#### S3 Driver Configuration

An S3 disk configuration array is located in your `config/filesystems.php` configuration file. Typically, you should configure your S3 information and credentials using the following environment variables which are referenced by the `config/filesystems.php` configuration file:

```ini
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key-id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=<your-bucket-name>
AWS_ROOT=
AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT=false
```

The credential variables use the AWS SDK's standard names, while the region follows the AWS CLI convention. The remaining `AWS_*` values configure this S3 disk and work with any compatible service.

The optional `AWS_ROOT` value scopes the disk to a key prefix within the bucket. When it is empty, the disk operates from the bucket root.

If you supply a callable `credentials` provider, calls to that provider run one at a time, including when it is shared with SQS or SES. Hypervel does not cache provider results. If your provider fetches the same credentials remotely for every caller, wrap it with the AWS SDK's `CredentialProvider::memoize()` to reuse them until they need refreshing. Do not share a memoized provider between callers that need different credentials, such as different tenants.

<a name="ftp-driver-configuration"></a>
#### FTP Driver Configuration

Before using the FTP driver, you will need to install the Flysystem FTP package via the Composer package manager:

```shell
composer require league/flysystem-ftp "^3.0"
```

Hypervel's Flysystem integrations work great with FTP; however, a sample configuration is not included with the framework's default `config/filesystems.php` configuration file. If you need to configure an FTP filesystem, you may use the configuration example below:

```php
'ftp' => [
    'driver' => 'ftp',
    'host' => env('FTP_HOST'),
    'username' => env('FTP_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('FTP_PASSWORD'),

    // Optional FTP Settings...
    // 'port' => (int) env('FTP_PORT', 21),
    // 'root' => env('FTP_ROOT'),
    // 'passive' => true,
    // 'ssl' => true,
    // 'timeout' => 30,
],
```

<a name="sftp-driver-configuration"></a>
#### SFTP Driver Configuration

Before using the SFTP driver, you will need to install the Flysystem SFTP package via the Composer package manager:

```shell
composer require league/flysystem-sftp-v3 "^3.0"
```

Hypervel's Flysystem integrations work great with SFTP; however, a sample configuration is not included with the framework's default `config/filesystems.php` configuration file. If you need to configure an SFTP filesystem, you may use the configuration example below:

```php
'sftp' => [
    'driver' => 'sftp',
    'host' => env('SFTP_HOST'),

    // Settings for basic authentication...
    'username' => env('SFTP_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('SFTP_PASSWORD'),

    // Settings for SSH key-based authentication with encryption password...
    'privateKey' => env('SFTP_PRIVATE_KEY'),
    'passphrase' => env('SFTP_PASSPHRASE'),

    // Settings for file / directory permissions...
    'visibility' => 'private', // `private` = 0600, `public` = 0644
    'directory_visibility' => 'private', // `private` = 0700, `public` = 0755

    // Optional SFTP Settings...
    // 'hostFingerprint' => env('SFTP_HOST_FINGERPRINT'),
    // 'maxTries' => 4,
    // 'passphrase' => env('SFTP_PASSPHRASE'),
    // 'port' => (int) env('SFTP_PORT', 22),
    // 'root' => env('SFTP_ROOT', ''),
    // 'timeout' => 30,
    // 'useAgent' => true,
],
```

<a name="gcs-driver-configuration"></a>
#### Google Cloud Storage Driver Configuration

Before using the Google Cloud Storage driver, you will need to install the Flysystem Google Cloud Storage package via the Composer package manager:

```shell
composer require league/flysystem-google-cloud-storage "^3.0"
```

A Google Cloud Storage disk configuration array is located in your `config/filesystems.php` configuration file. Typically, you should configure your Google Cloud Storage information and credentials using the following environment variables which are referenced by the `config/filesystems.php` configuration file:

```ini
GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE=<path-to-service-account-json>
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your-bucket-name>
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_PATH_PREFIX=
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_API_URI=
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_API_ENDPOINT=
```

If you need to configure a Google Cloud Storage filesystem manually, you may use the configuration example below:

```php
'gcs' => [
    'driver' => 'gcs',
    'key_file_path' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE'),
    'key_file' => [],
    'project_id' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID', 'your-project-id'),
    'bucket' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET', 'your-bucket'),
    'path_prefix' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_PATH_PREFIX', ''),
    'storage_api_uri' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_API_URI'),
    'api_endpoint' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_API_ENDPOINT'),
    'visibility_handler' => null,
    'metadata' => ['cacheControl' => 'public,max-age=86400'],
    'throw' => false,
    'stream_reads' => true,
    'pool' => [
        'min_retained_objects' => 1,
        'max_objects' => 10,
        'wait_timeout' => 3.0,
        'max_lifetime' => 60.0,
        'max_idle_time' => null,
        'pool_idle_timeout' => 300.0,
    ],
],
```

<a name="driver-pools"></a>
### Driver Pools

The `s3` and `gcs` drivers pool their SDK clients by default. The bucket-specific Flysystem adapter stack is rebuilt around a borrowed client for each operation. This lets disks on the same cloud account share the expensive client pool even when their buckets, roots, visibility, or other disk behavior differ.

Pool identity is derived from the exact normalized configuration passed to the SDK client constructor. Equivalent client configurations converge automatically, including repeated `Storage::build()` calls. These configurations must use the same pool options; a mismatch throws immediately instead of silently reusing the first configuration's settings. Different credentials, regions, endpoints, or client options produce different pools.

You may configure a pool using the disk's `pool` option:

```php
's3' => [
    'driver' => 's3',
    // ...
    'pool' => [
        'min_retained_objects' => 1,
        'max_objects' => 10,
        'wait_timeout' => 3.0,
        'max_lifetime' => 60.0,
        'max_idle_time' => null,
        'pool_idle_timeout' => 300.0,
    ],
],
```

`min_retained_objects` is an idle-trimming floor; it does not eagerly create clients. `max_lifetime` expires clients by absolute age, while `max_idle_time` trims individual idle clients. `pool_idle_timeout` removes an entirely unused pool after 300 seconds by default. Set any of these three optional durations to `null` to disable it. If all clients are in use and no capacity becomes available before `wait_timeout`, a `RuntimeException` is thrown.

An explicit pool name may be useful when multiple configurations intentionally identify the same operational resource:

```php
'pool' => [
    'name' => 'primary-s3',
    'fingerprint' => 'primary-s3-credentials-v1',
    'max_objects' => 20,
],
```

An existing explicit name may only be reused with the same resource type, construction fingerprint, and normalized options. Mismatches fail immediately instead of silently sharing clients with different credentials. `pool.fingerprint` is also the required way to declare equivalence when SDK client configuration contains an object, closure, or resource that cannot be canonicalized automatically. For example, the Google Cloud SDK recommends a `credentialsFetcher` object instead of externally sourced `keyFile` configuration:

```php
'gcs' => [
    'driver' => 'gcs',
    'bucket' => 'documents',
    'client' => [
        'projectId' => 'example-project',
        'credentialsFetcher' => $credentialsFetcher,
    ],
    'pool' => [
        'fingerprint' => 'example-project-credentials-v1',
    ],
],
```

Pooled disks do not expose a borrowed SDK client, adapter, or Flysystem driver after its operation has finished. Use `withClient()`, `withAdapter()`, or `withDriver()` for raw access that remains inside the borrow:

```php
$result = Storage::disk('s3')->withClient(function ($client) {
    return $client->listBuckets();
});
```

`Storage::forgetDisk()` only removes the manager's cached disk wrapper; an equivalent wrapper can continue using the shared pool. `Storage::purge()` removes the wrapper and closes its current pool, deriving the same pool identity even when the named disk has not been resolved yet or is composed from nested scoped disks. Other disks converging on that pool transparently create a fresh one on their next operation. Streams returned by `readStream()` or `readStreamRange()` retain their client lease until the stream is closed or destroyed.

S3 and Google Cloud Storage streams are read lazily by default, which keeps memory usage bounded and makes data available before the entire file has downloaded. This applies to `readStream()` and `readStreamRange()`; methods such as `get()` retain their normal behavior. Streaming requests close their HTTP connection after the read, so applications that open many small streams may prefer connection reuse and set the disk's `stream_reads` option to `false`.

<a name="scoped-and-read-only-filesystems"></a>
### Scoped, Read-Only, and Read-Through Filesystems

Scoped disks allow you to define a filesystem where all paths are automatically prefixed with a given path prefix.

You may create a path scoped instance of any existing filesystem disk by defining a disk that utilizes the `scoped` driver. For example, you may create a disk which scopes your existing `s3` disk to a specific path prefix, and then every file operation using your scoped disk will utilize the specified prefix:

```php
's3-videos' => [
    'driver' => 'scoped',
    'disk' => 's3',
    'prefix' => 'path/to/videos',
],
```

A scoped disk may also define its own `visibility`, `throw`, `report`, `read-only`, and `pool` options. When scopes are nested, the first non-null value from the outermost scope is used. Other construction settings continue to come from the base disk.

Scoped S3 and Google Cloud Storage disks reuse their base disk's SDK client pool. Their pool options must therefore match the base disk and every other scoped view that shares that client. Hypervel throws an exception when these options conflict.

For a prefix that changes per request, user, team, or tenant, wrap an existing disk with `ScopedFilesystemProxy` or `ScopedCloudFilesystemProxy`. The resolver runs exactly once for each operation, so it may safely read coroutine-scoped context:

```php
use Hypervel\Context\CoroutineContext;
use Hypervel\Filesystem\ScopedCloudFilesystemProxy;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$files = new ScopedCloudFilesystemProxy(
    Storage::disk('s3'),
    fn (): string => CoroutineContext::get('storage-prefix'),
);

$files->put('avatar.jpg', $contents);
```

You may also resolve the underlying disk for each operation. This is useful when credentials, buckets, or other disk configuration depend on coroutine context:

```php
use Hypervel\Context\CoroutineContext;
use Hypervel\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem;
use Hypervel\Filesystem\ScopedFilesystemProxy;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$files = new ScopedFilesystemProxy(
    fn (): Filesystem => Storage::build(CoroutineContext::get('storage-config')),
    fn (): string => CoroutineContext::get('storage-prefix'),
);

$files->put('avatar.jpg', $contents);
```

The disk and prefix resolvers are each called once per operation. For `image()`, both are resolved when the image is created and captured for its later lazy read, as described under [Images](#retrieving-images). Keep the disk resolver fast by reading values already available in memory. Equivalent S3 and Google Cloud Storage configurations created with `Storage::build()` reuse the same client pool. Use `ScopedCloudFilesystemProxy` when you need methods from the `Cloud` contract, such as `url()`. Every disk returned by its resolver must implement that contract, or the first operation throws a `TypeError`.

Dynamic scoped filesystems fail closed when the resolved prefix is empty. Pass `allowRootPassthrough: true` to the constructor only when root access is intentional. Prefixes and user paths are normalized with Flysystem's path normalizer, traversal and control characters are rejected, and unknown methods are not forwarded because an unmapped call could bypass the scope. Percent-encoded segments are treated as literal file names; URL decoding belongs at the HTTP boundary.

"Read-only" disks allow you to create filesystem disks that do not allow write operations. You may include the `read-only` configuration option on a base or scoped disk:

```php
's3-archive' => [
    'driver' => 's3',
    // ...
    'read-only' => true,
],

's3-videos' => [
    'driver' => 'scoped',
    'disk' => 's3',
    'prefix' => 'path/to/videos',
    'read-only' => true,
],
```

Failed writes follow the scoped disk's `throw` and `report` options.

Read-through disks allow you to migrate files between disks without downtime. When reading a file, Hypervel checks the primary disk first. If the file only exists on the fallback disk, Hypervel reads it from the fallback disk and copies it to the primary disk for future requests:

```php
'assets' => [
    'driver' => 'read-through',
    'primary' => 's3',
    'fallback' => 'legacy-s3',
],
```

New files and directory listings use the primary disk. URLs, file existence checks, and metadata use the disk containing the file without copying it. Deletions remove files or directories from both disks, and visibility changes apply to the disk containing the file. The `primary` and `fallback` options may also contain inline disk configurations.

To scope a read-through disk per request or tenant, wrap it in `ScopedCloudFilesystemProxy`. Dynamic scoped proxies cannot be used as its primary or fallback disk.

Fallback reads promote files by default. Set `copy` to `false` to read fallback files without copying them. With promotion enabled, fallback stream reads finish copying the file before returning the stream. Stream promotion and fallback copy/move operations buffer up to 2 MB in memory, then use PHP's system temporary directory; allow enough temporary disk space for large files and concurrent operations.

Promoted files use the primary disk's default visibility rather than inheriting the fallback file's visibility. Fallback copy and move operations use the same default. Configure a private primary disk when migrating private files.

Promotion does not lock files across the two disks. Coordinate writes and deletions to a path while it is being copied; otherwise, promotion can overwrite a concurrent write or restore a deleted file.

By default, a `FilesystemException` raised while writing the promoted copy does not fail the read. Set `throw_on_promotion_failure` to `true` to treat it as a read failure; set the disk's `throw` option to `true` to receive that failure as an exception. Other errors, including pool wait timeouts, still propagate.

<a name="amazon-s3-compatible-filesystems"></a>
### Amazon S3 Compatible Filesystems

By default, your application's `filesystems` configuration file contains a disk configuration for the `s3` disk. In addition to using this disk to interact with [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), you may use it to interact with any S3-compatible file storage service such as [RustFS](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs), [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), [Vultr Object Storage](https://www.vultr.com/products/object-storage/), [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/), or [Hetzner Cloud Storage](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/object-storage/).

Typically, after updating the disk's credentials to match the credentials of the service you are planning to use, you will need to update the value of the `endpoint` configuration option. This option's value is typically defined via the `AWS_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

```php
'endpoint' => env('AWS_ENDPOINT', 'https://rustfs:9000'),
```

Some S3-compatible services also require path-style URLs or a provider-specific region. Configure `AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` according to your storage provider's requirements.

<a name="obtaining-disk-instances"></a>
## Obtaining Disk Instances

The `Storage` facade may be used to interact with any of your configured disks. For example, you may use the `put` method on the facade to store an avatar on the default disk. If you call methods on the `Storage` facade without first calling the `disk` method, the method will automatically be passed to the default disk:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::put('avatars/1', $content);
```

If your application interacts with multiple disks, you may use the `disk` method on the `Storage` facade to work with files on a particular disk:

```php
Storage::disk('s3')->put('avatars/1', $content);
```

<a name="on-demand-disks"></a>
### On-Demand Disks

Sometimes you may wish to create a disk at runtime using a given configuration without that configuration actually being present in your application's `filesystems` configuration file. To accomplish this, you may pass a configuration array to the `Storage` facade's `build` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$disk = Storage::build([
    'driver' => 'local',
    'root' => '/path/to/root',
]);

$disk->put('image.jpg', $content);
```

You may also pass a logical disk name as the second argument:

```php
$disk = Storage::build($configuration, 'tenant-uploads');
```

Hypervel uses this name as part of the pool identity for drivers that pool the complete filesystem instance. An on-demand disk does not register a serving route of its own. When a named on-demand disk enables `serve`, Hypervel generates signed URLs through the configured served disk with that name. Use matching storage configuration because the route resolves the configured disk, not the on-demand instance. An anonymous scoped disk may instead generate signed URLs through a named parent disk that has serving enabled. S3 and Google Cloud Storage client pools continue to use the client configuration rather than the logical disk name.

The disk name `ondemand` is reserved and cannot be used in your `filesystems.disks` configuration. In tests, `Storage::fake('ondemand')` or `Storage::persistentFake('ondemand')` replaces disks returned by `Storage::build()` when no logical name is supplied. Builds with an explicit logical name continue to use their own configuration.

<a name="retrieving-files"></a>
## Retrieving Files

The `get` method may be used to retrieve the contents of a file. The raw string contents of the file will be returned by the method. Remember, all file paths should be specified relative to the disk's "root" location:

```php
$contents = Storage::get('file.jpg');
```

If the file you are retrieving contains JSON, you may use the `json` method to retrieve the file and decode its contents:

```php
$orders = Storage::json('orders.json');
```

The `exists` method may be used to determine if a file or directory exists on the disk:

```php
if (Storage::disk('s3')->exists('file.jpg')) {
    // ...
}
```

The `missing` method may be used to determine if a file or directory is missing from the disk:

```php
if (Storage::disk('s3')->missing('file.jpg')) {
    // ...
}
```

If you need to determine whether a path specifically points to a file or a directory, you may use the `fileExists`, `fileMissing`, `directoryExists`, and `directoryMissing` methods:

```php
if (Storage::disk('s3')->fileExists('file.jpg')) {
    // ...
}

if (Storage::disk('s3')->directoryMissing('photos')) {
    // ...
}
```

The `Hypervel\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem` contract includes `exists`, `fileExists`, and `directoryExists`, so these checks are available when a disk is injected through the contract. Custom implementations must provide all three methods.

<a name="retrieving-images"></a>
### Images

After installing `hypervel/image`, you may create an image from a file already stored on any filesystem disk. The file is read when the image is first materialized, such as when it is inspected, converted to bytes, processed, or stored:

```php
$image = Storage::disk('public')->image('avatars/photo.jpg');
```

You may then resize, crop, convert, or store the image using Hypervel's [image manipulation features](/docs/{{version}}/images).

When `image()` is called on a dynamic `ScopedFilesystemProxy` or `ScopedCloudFilesystemProxy`, the current disk and non-empty prefix are captured when the image is created. This prevents an image from crossing tenant boundaries if it is processed after the coroutine context changes. An empty prefix fails immediately unless the proxy was deliberately constructed with `allowRootPassthrough: true`.

<a name="downloading-files"></a>
### Downloading Files

The `download` method may be used to generate a response that forces the user's browser to download the file at the given path. The `download` method accepts a filename as the second argument to the method, which will determine the filename that is seen by the user downloading the file. Finally, you may pass an array of HTTP headers as the third argument to the method:

```php
return Storage::download('file.jpg');

return Storage::download('file.jpg', $name, $headers);
```

If you would like to display a file, such as an image or PDF, directly in the user's browser instead of initiating a download, you may use the `response` method:

```php
return Storage::response('file.jpg');
```

<a name="file-urls"></a>
### File URLs

You may use the `url` method to get the URL for a given file. If you are using the `local` driver, this will typically just prepend `/storage` to the given path and return a relative URL to the file. If you are using the `s3` or `gcs` driver, the fully qualified remote URL will be returned:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$url = Storage::url('file.jpg');
```

When using the `local` driver, all files that should be publicly accessible should be placed in the `storage/app/public` directory. Furthermore, you should [create a symbolic link](#the-public-disk) at `public/storage` which points to the `storage/app/public` directory.

<a name="url-host-customization"></a>
#### URL Host Customization

If you would like to modify the host for URLs generated using the `Storage` facade, you may add or change the `url` option in the disk's configuration array:

```php
'public' => [
    'driver' => 'local',
    'root' => storage_path('app/public'),
    'url' => rtrim((string) env('APP_URL'), '/').'/storage',
    'visibility' => 'public',
    'throw' => false,
],
```

<a name="temporary-urls"></a>
### Temporary URLs

Using the `temporaryUrl` method, you may create temporary URLs to files stored using the `local`, `s3`, and `gcs` drivers. This method accepts a path and a `DateTimeInterface` instance specifying when the URL should expire:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$url = Storage::temporaryUrl(
    'file.jpg', now()->plus(minutes: 5)
);
```

<a name="serving-files-from-configured-disks"></a>
#### Serving Files From Configured Disks

Hypervel's signed download and upload routes allow you to generate temporary URLs for disks that cannot create them on their own, such as disks using the `local` driver. The default `local` disk enables these routes using the `serve` option in your application's `config/filesystems.php` configuration file:

```php
'local' => [
    'driver' => 'local',
    'root' => storage_path('app/private'),
    'serve' => true,
    'visibility' => 'private',
    'throw' => false,
],
```

Any other configured disk may enable these routes by adding the `serve` option to its configuration array. Each served disk registers its routes at its `url` path, or at `/storage` when it has no `url`, so every served disk must use a different path. Custom filesystem drivers that enable the `serve` option must provide the filesystem response methods used to serve and receive files.

A named scoped disk uses its own route when it enables `serve`. Otherwise, it uses the nearest named parent disk with serving enabled and includes each intervening scope in the signed path. Anonymous scoped disks cannot register routes, but they may use a named served parent.

Each scoped disk that owns a route must configure a distinct `url`; otherwise, it may collide with a served parent that uses the default `/storage` path. This `url` defines the signed route only. The disk's ordinary `url()` method continues to use its base disk's URL and effective storage prefix.

The route owner's visibility controls whether a file needs a signature. Setting a different visibility on an outer scoped disk does not change the route owner's signature policy.

If you need to specify additional [S3 request parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html#RESTObjectGET-requests), you may pass the array of request parameters as the third argument to the `temporaryUrl` method:

```php
$url = Storage::temporaryUrl(
    'file.jpg',
    now()->plus(minutes: 5),
    [
        'ResponseContentType' => 'application/octet-stream',
        'ResponseContentDisposition' => 'attachment; filename=file2.jpg',
    ]
);
```

<a name="customizing-temporary-urls"></a>
#### Customizing Temporary URLs

If you need to customize how temporary URLs are created for a specific storage disk, you can use the `buildTemporaryUrlsUsing` method. For example, this can be useful if you have a controller that allows you to download files stored via a disk that doesn't typically support temporary URLs. Usually, this method should be called from the `boot` method of a service provider:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use DateTimeInterface;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\URL;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Storage::disk('local')->buildTemporaryUrlsUsing(
            function (string $path, DateTimeInterface $expiration, array $options) {
                return URL::temporarySignedRoute(
                    'files.download',
                    $expiration,
                    array_merge($options, ['path' => $path])
                );
            }
        );
    }
}
```

<a name="temporary-upload-urls"></a>
#### Temporary Upload URLs

> [!WARNING]
> The ability to generate temporary upload URLs is only supported by the `local`, `s3`, and `gcs` drivers.

If you need to generate a temporary URL that can be used to upload a file directly from your client-side application, you may use the `temporaryUploadUrl` method. This method accepts a path and a `DateTimeInterface` instance specifying when the URL should expire.

For the `local` and `s3` drivers, the `temporaryUploadUrl` method returns an associative array which may be destructured into the upload URL and the headers that should be included with the upload request:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

['url' => $url, 'headers' => $headers] = Storage::temporaryUploadUrl(
    'file.jpg', now()->plus(minutes: 5)
);
```

When using the `gcs` driver, the method returns a signed upload session URL string:

```php
$url = Storage::temporaryUploadUrl(
    'file.jpg', now()->plus(minutes: 5)
);
```

Google Cloud Storage determines the lifetime of the upload session. This method is primarily useful when your client-side application needs to upload files directly to a storage system such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

<a name="file-metadata"></a>
### File Metadata

In addition to reading and writing files, Hypervel can also provide information about the files themselves. For example, the `size` method may be used to get the size of a file in bytes:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$size = Storage::size('file.jpg');
```

The `lastModified` method returns the UNIX timestamp of the last time the file was modified:

```php
$time = Storage::lastModified('file.jpg');
```

The MIME type of a given file may be obtained via the `mimeType` method:

```php
$mime = Storage::mimeType('file.jpg');
```

The checksum of a given file may be obtained via the `checksum` method:

```php
$checksum = Storage::checksum('file.jpg');
```

<a name="file-paths"></a>
#### File Paths

You may use the `path` method to get the path for a given file. If you are using the `local` driver, this will return the absolute path to the file. If you are using a cloud driver, this method will return the relative path to the file in the remote bucket:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$path = Storage::path('file.jpg');
```

<a name="storing-files"></a>
## Storing Files

The `put` method may be used to store file contents on a disk. You may also pass a PHP `resource` to the `put` method, which will use Flysystem's underlying stream support. Remember, all file paths should be specified relative to the "root" location configured for the disk:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::put('file.jpg', $contents);

Storage::put('file.jpg', $resource);
```

<a name="failed-writes"></a>
#### Failed Writes

If the `put` method (or other "write" operations) is unable to write the file to disk, `false` will be returned:

```php
if (! Storage::put('file.jpg', $contents)) {
    // The file could not be written to disk...
}
```

If you wish, you may define the `throw` option within your filesystem disk's configuration array. When this option is defined as `true`, "write" methods such as `put` will throw an instance of `League\Flysystem\UnableToWriteFile` when write operations fail:

```php
'public' => [
    'driver' => 'local',
    // ...
    'throw' => true,
],
```

When `throw` is `false`, you may set the `report` option to `true` to report the underlying Flysystem exception through your application's exception handler while preserving the method's normal failure return value:

```php
'public' => [
    'driver' => 'local',
    // ...
    'throw' => false,
    'report' => true,
],
```

If neither the `throw` nor `report` options are defined, the disk will silently return `false` on failure and the underlying exception will not be thrown or logged.

<a name="prepending-appending-to-files"></a>
### Prepending and Appending To Files

The `prepend` and `append` methods allow you to write to the beginning or end of a file:

```php
Storage::prepend('file.log', 'Prepended Text');

Storage::append('file.log', 'Appended Text');
```

By default, the new and existing contents are separated by a newline. You may pass a different separator as the third argument:

```php
Storage::append('file.log', 'Appended Text', ' | ');
```

<a name="copying-moving-files"></a>
### Copying and Moving Files

The `copy` method may be used to copy an existing file to a new location on the disk, while the `move` method may be used to rename or move an existing file to a new location:

```php
Storage::copy('old/file.jpg', 'new/file.jpg');

Storage::move('old/file.jpg', 'new/file.jpg');
```

You may use the `copyToDisk` and `moveToDisk` methods to copy or move a file to another disk. The source file's path will be used on the destination disk unless you provide a third argument:

```php
Storage::disk('local')->copyToDisk('s3', 'reports/report.csv');

Storage::disk('local')->moveToDisk(
    's3', 'reports/report.csv', 'archive/report.csv'
);
```

Transfers from pooled disks, including S3 and Google Cloud Storage, buffer the source before writing to the destination so the source's pool slot is available during the write. Buffering keeps up to 2 MB in memory per transfer, then uses PHP's system temporary directory; allow enough temporary disk space for large files and concurrent transfers. Local sources stream directly.

<a name="automatic-streaming"></a>
### Automatic Streaming

Streaming files to storage offers significantly reduced memory usage. If you would like Hypervel to automatically manage streaming a given file to your storage location, you may use the `putFile` or `putFileAs` method. This method accepts either a `Hypervel\Http\File` or `Hypervel\Http\UploadedFile` instance and will automatically stream the file to your desired location:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\File;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

// Automatically generate a unique ID for filename...
$path = Storage::putFile('photos', new File('/path/to/photo'));

// Manually specify a filename...
$path = Storage::putFileAs('photos', new File('/path/to/photo'), 'photo.jpg');
```

There are a few important things to note about the `putFile` method. Note that we only specified a directory name and not a filename. By default, the `putFile` method will generate a unique ID to serve as the filename. The file's extension will be determined by examining the file's MIME type. The path to the file will be returned by the `putFile` method so you can store the path, including the generated filename, in your database.

The `putFile` and `putFileAs` methods also accept an argument to specify the "visibility" of the stored file. This is particularly useful if you are storing the file on a cloud disk such as Amazon S3 and would like the file to be publicly accessible via generated URLs:

```php
Storage::putFile('photos', new File('/path/to/photo'), 'public');
```

<a name="file-uploads"></a>
### File Uploads

In web applications, one of the most common use-cases for storing files is storing user uploaded files such as photos and documents. Hypervel makes it very easy to store uploaded files using the `store` method on an uploaded file instance. Call the `store` method with the path at which you wish to store the uploaded file:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Hypervel\Http\Request;

class UserAvatarController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Update the avatar for the user.
     */
    public function update(Request $request): string
    {
        $path = $request->file('avatar')->store('avatars');

        return $path;
    }
}
```

There are a few important things to note about this example. Note that we only specified a directory name, not a filename. By default, the `store` method will generate a unique ID to serve as the filename. The file's extension will be determined by examining the file's MIME type. The path to the file will be returned by the `store` method so you can store the path, including the generated filename, in your database.

You may also call the `putFile` method on the `Storage` facade to perform the same file storage operation as the example above:

```php
$path = Storage::putFile('avatars', $request->file('avatar'));
```

<a name="specifying-a-file-name"></a>
#### Specifying a File Name

If you do not want a filename to be automatically assigned to your stored file, you may use the `storeAs` method, which receives the path, the filename, and the (optional) disk as its arguments:

```php
$path = $request->file('avatar')->storeAs(
    'avatars', $request->user()->id
);
```

You may also use the `putFileAs` method on the `Storage` facade, which will perform the same file storage operation as the example above:

```php
$path = Storage::putFileAs(
    'avatars', $request->file('avatar'), $request->user()->id
);
```

> [!WARNING]
> Unprintable and invalid unicode characters will automatically be removed from file paths. Therefore, you may wish to sanitize your file paths before passing them to Hypervel's file storage methods. File paths are normalized using the `League\Flysystem\WhitespacePathNormalizer::normalizePath` method.

<a name="specifying-a-disk"></a>
#### Specifying a Disk

By default, this uploaded file's `store` method will use your default disk. If you would like to specify another disk, pass the disk name as the second argument to the `store` method:

```php
$path = $request->file('avatar')->store(
    'avatars/'.$request->user()->id, 's3'
);
```

If you are using the `storeAs` method, you may pass the disk name as the third argument to the method:

```php
$path = $request->file('avatar')->storeAs(
    'avatars',
    $request->user()->id,
    's3'
);
```

<a name="other-uploaded-file-information"></a>
#### Other Uploaded File Information

If you would like to get the original name and extension of the uploaded file, you may do so using the `getClientOriginalName` and `getClientOriginalExtension` methods:

```php
$file = $request->file('avatar');

$name = $file->getClientOriginalName();
$extension = $file->getClientOriginalExtension();
```

However, keep in mind that the `getClientOriginalName` and `getClientOriginalExtension` methods are considered unsafe, as the file name and extension may be tampered with by a malicious user. For this reason, you should typically prefer the `hashName` and `extension` methods to get a name and an extension for the given file upload:

```php
$file = $request->file('avatar');

$name = $file->hashName(); // Generate a unique, random name...
$extension = $file->extension(); // Determine the file's extension based on the file's MIME type...
```

If you need to resize, crop, or convert an uploaded image before storing it, you may use Hypervel's [image manipulation features](/docs/{{version}}/images):

```php
$path = $request->image('avatar')
    ->cover(400, 400)
    ->toWebp()
    ->storePublicly('avatars', 'public');
```

<a name="file-visibility"></a>
### File Visibility

In Hypervel's Flysystem integration, "visibility" is an abstraction of file permissions across multiple platforms. Files may either be declared `public` or `private`. When a file is declared `public`, you are indicating that the file should generally be accessible to others. For example, when using the S3 driver, you may retrieve URLs for `public` files.

You can set the visibility when writing the file via the `put` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::put('file.jpg', $contents, 'public');
```

If the file has already been stored, its visibility can be retrieved and set via the `getVisibility` and `setVisibility` methods:

```php
$visibility = Storage::getVisibility('file.jpg');

Storage::setVisibility('file.jpg', 'public');
```

When interacting with uploaded files, you may use the `storePublicly` and `storePubliclyAs` methods to store the uploaded file with `public` visibility:

```php
$path = $request->file('avatar')->storePublicly('avatars', 's3');

$path = $request->file('avatar')->storePubliclyAs(
    'avatars',
    $request->user()->id,
    's3'
);
```

<a name="local-files-and-visibility"></a>
#### Local Files and Visibility

When using the `local` driver, `public` [visibility](#file-visibility) translates to `0755` permissions for directories and `0644` permissions for files. You can modify the permissions mappings in your application's `filesystems` configuration file:

```php
'local' => [
    'driver' => 'local',
    'root' => storage_path('app'),
    'permissions' => [
        'file' => [
            'public' => 0644,
            'private' => 0600,
        ],
        'dir' => [
            'public' => 0755,
            'private' => 0700,
        ],
    ],
    'throw' => false,
],
```

<a name="image-manipulation"></a>
### Image Manipulation

If you need to resize, crop, or convert an uploaded image before storing it, you may use Hypervel's [image manipulation features](/docs/{{version}}/images):

```php
$path = $request->image('avatar')
    ->cover(400, 400)
    ->toWebp()
    ->storePublicly('avatars', 'public');
```

You may also create an image instance from a file already stored on one of your filesystem disks:

```php
$image = Storage::disk('public')->image('avatars/photo.jpg');
```

<a name="deleting-files"></a>
## Deleting Files

The `delete` method accepts a single filename or an array of files to delete:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::delete('file.jpg');

Storage::delete(['file.jpg', 'file2.jpg']);
```

If necessary, you may specify the disk that the file should be deleted from:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

Storage::disk('s3')->delete('path/file.jpg');
```

<a name="directories"></a>
## Directories

<a name="get-all-files-within-a-directory"></a>
#### Get All Files Within a Directory

The `files` method returns an array of all files within a given directory. If you would like to retrieve a list of all files within a given directory including subdirectories, you may use the `allFiles` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

$files = Storage::files($directory);

$files = Storage::allFiles($directory);
```

<a name="get-all-directories-within-a-directory"></a>
#### Get All Directories Within a Directory

The `directories` method returns an array of all directories within a given directory. If you would like to retrieve a list of all directories within a given directory including subdirectories, you may use the `allDirectories` method:

```php
$directories = Storage::directories($directory);

$directories = Storage::allDirectories($directory);
```

<a name="create-a-directory"></a>
#### Create a Directory

The `makeDirectory` method will create the given directory, including any needed subdirectories:

```php
Storage::makeDirectory($directory);
```

<a name="delete-a-directory"></a>
#### Delete a Directory

Finally, the `deleteDirectory` method may be used to remove a directory and all of its files:

```php
Storage::deleteDirectory($directory);
```

<a name="testing"></a>
## Testing

The `Storage` facade's `fake` method allows you to easily generate a fake disk that, combined with the file generation utilities of the `Hypervel\Http\UploadedFile` class, greatly simplifies the testing of file uploads. For example:

```php tab=Pest
<?php

use Hypervel\Http\UploadedFile;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;

test('albums can be uploaded', function () {
    Storage::fake('photos');

    // Assert that the disk contains no files...
    Storage::disk('photos')->assertEmpty();

    $response = $this->json('POST', '/photos', [
        UploadedFile::fake()->image('photo1.jpg'),
        UploadedFile::fake()->image('photo2.jpg')
    ]);

    // Assert one or more files were stored...
    Storage::disk('photos')->assertExists('photo1.jpg');
    Storage::disk('photos')->assertExists(['photo1.jpg', 'photo2.jpg']);

    // Assert one or more files were not stored...
    Storage::disk('photos')->assertMissing('missing.jpg');
    Storage::disk('photos')->assertMissing(['missing.jpg', 'non-existing.jpg']);

    // Assert that the number of files in a given directory matches the expected count...
    Storage::disk('photos')->assertCount('/wallpapers', 2);

    Storage::disk('photos')->makeDirectory('/empty');

    // Assert that a given directory is empty...
    Storage::disk('photos')->assertDirectoryEmpty('/empty');
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Hypervel\Http\UploadedFile;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_albums_can_be_uploaded(): void
    {
        Storage::fake('photos');

        // Assert that the disk contains no files...
        Storage::disk('photos')->assertEmpty();

        $response = $this->json('POST', '/photos', [
            UploadedFile::fake()->image('photo1.jpg'),
            UploadedFile::fake()->image('photo2.jpg')
        ]);

        // Assert one or more files were stored...
        Storage::disk('photos')->assertExists('photo1.jpg');
        Storage::disk('photos')->assertExists(['photo1.jpg', 'photo2.jpg']);

        // Assert one or more files were not stored...
        Storage::disk('photos')->assertMissing('missing.jpg');
        Storage::disk('photos')->assertMissing(['missing.jpg', 'non-existing.jpg']);

        // Assert that the number of files in a given directory matches the expected count...
        Storage::disk('photos')->assertCount('/wallpapers', 2);

        Storage::disk('photos')->makeDirectory('/empty');

        // Assert that a given directory is empty...
        Storage::disk('photos')->assertDirectoryEmpty('/empty');
    }
}
```

By default, the `fake` method will delete all files in its temporary directory. If you would like to keep these files, you may use the "persistentFake" method instead. For more information on testing file uploads, you may consult the [HTTP testing documentation's information on file uploads](/docs/{{version}}/http-tests#testing-file-uploads).

> [!WARNING]
> The `image` method requires the [GD extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php).

<a name="custom-filesystems"></a>
## Custom Filesystems

Hypervel's Flysystem integration provides support for several "drivers" out of the box; however, Flysystem is not limited to these and has adapters for many other storage systems. You can create a custom driver if you want to use one of these additional adapters in your Hypervel application.

In order to define a custom filesystem you will need a Flysystem adapter. Let's add a community maintained Dropbox adapter to our project:

```shell
composer require spatie/flysystem-dropbox
```

Next, you can register the driver within the `boot` method of one of your application's [service providers](/docs/{{version}}/providers). To accomplish this, you should use the `extend` method of the `Storage` facade:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Hypervel\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Hypervel\Filesystem\FilesystemAdapter;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Storage;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;
use Spatie\Dropbox\Client as DropboxClient;
use Spatie\FlysystemDropbox\DropboxAdapter;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Storage::extend('dropbox', function (Application $app, array $config) {
            $adapter = new DropboxAdapter(new DropboxClient(
                $config['authorization_token']
            ));

            return new FilesystemAdapter(
                new Filesystem($adapter, $config),
                $adapter,
                $config
            );
        }, poolable: true);
    }
}
```

The first argument of the `extend` method is the name of the driver and the second is a closure that receives the `$app` and `$config` variables. The closure may also accept the disk's logical name as a third argument. This value is `null` for an anonymous on-demand disk:

```php
Storage::extend('dropbox', function (Application $app, array $config, ?string $name) {
    // ...
});
```

The closure must return an instance of `Hypervel\Filesystem\FilesystemAdapter`. The `$config` variable contains the values defined in `config/filesystems.php` for the specified disk. You may omit the third argument when your driver does not need the disk name.

The optional `poolable` argument determines whether Hypervel should wrap the custom driver in an object pool. This value is `false` by default. You should set it to `true` for custom drivers that hold state that should not be shared across concurrent requests, such as cloud storage SDK clients.

Custom whole-driver pools include the logical disk name in their construction fingerprint. If the name does not affect your custom driver and several named disks may safely share one pool, configure the same `pool.fingerprint` for each disk. A shared `pool.name` may also choose the pool's identity, but it does not replace the shared fingerprint.

Once you have created and registered the extension's service provider, you may use the `dropbox` driver in your `config/filesystems.php` configuration file.
