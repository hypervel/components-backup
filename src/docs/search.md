## Introduction

Almost every application needs search. Whether your users are searching a knowledge base for relevant articles, exploring a product catalog, or asking natural-language questions against a corpus of documents, Hypervel provides built-in tools to handle each of these scenarios — and you often don't need any external services to get there.

Most applications will find that the built-in database-powered options provided by Hypervel are more than sufficient — external search services are only necessary when you need features like typo tolerance, faceted filtering, or geo-search at massive scale.

#### Full-Text Search

When you need keyword relevance ranking — where the database scores and sorts results based on how well they match the search terms — Hypervel's `whereFullText` query builder method leverages native full-text indexes on MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. Full-text search understands word boundaries and stemming, so a search for "running" can match records containing "run". No external service is required.

<a name="introduction-semantic-vector-search"></a>
#### Semantic / Vector Search

For semantic search that matches results by *meaning* rather than exact keywords, the `whereVectorSimilarTo` query builder method uses vector embeddings stored in PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension or MariaDB. For example, a search for "best wineries in Napa Valley" can surface an article titled "Top Vineyards to Visit" — even though the words don't overlap. Vector search requires PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension or MariaDB 11.7 or later, as well as pre-computed vector embeddings.

#### Hypervel Scout Search

For applications that want a `Searchable` trait that automatically keeps search indexes in sync with Eloquent models, [Hypervel Scout](/docs/{{version}}/scout) offers both a built-in database engine and drivers for third-party services like Algolia, Meilisearch, Typesense, and Turbopuffer.

<a name="full-text-search"></a>
## Full-Text Search

While `LIKE` queries work well for simple substring matching, they don't understand language. A `LIKE` search for "running" won't find a record containing "run", and results aren't ranked by relevance — they're simply returned in whatever order the database finds them. Full-text search solves both of these problems by using specialized indexes that understand word boundaries, stemming, and relevance scoring, allowing the database to return the most relevant results first.

Fast full-text search is built into MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL — no external search service is required. You only need to add a full-text index to the columns you want to search, and then use the `whereFullText` query builder method to search against them.

> [!WARNING]
> Full-text search is currently supported by MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

<a name="adding-full-text-indexes"></a>
### Adding Full-Text Indexes

To use full-text search, first add a full-text index to the columns you want to search. You may add the index to a single column, or pass an array of columns to create a composite index that searches across multiple fields at once:

```php
Schema::create('articles', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('title');
    $table->text('body');
    $table->timestamps();

    $table->fullText(['title', 'body']);
});
```

On PostgreSQL, you may specify a language configuration for the index, which controls how words are stemmed:

```php
$table->fullText('body')->language('english');
```

For more information on creating indexes, consult the [migration documentation](/docs/{{version}}/migrations#available-index-types).

<a name="running-full-text-queries"></a>
### Running Full-Text Queries

Once the index is in place, use the `whereFullText` query builder method to search against it. Hypervel will generate the appropriate SQL for your database driver — for example, `MATCH(...) AGAINST(...)` on MariaDB and MySQL, and `to_tsvector(...) @@ plainto_tsquery(...)` on PostgreSQL:

```php
$articles = Article::whereFullText('body', 'web developer')->get();
```

When using MariaDB and MySQL, results are automatically ordered by relevance score. On PostgreSQL, `whereFullText` filters matching records but does not order them by relevance — if you need automatic relevance ordering on PostgreSQL, consider using [Scout's database engine](#database-engine), which handles this for you.

If you created a composite full-text index across multiple columns, you may search against all of them by passing the same array of columns to `whereFullText`:

```php
$articles = Article::whereFullText(
    ['title', 'body'], 'web developer'
)->get();
```

The `orWhereFullText` method may be used to add a full-text search clause as an "or" condition. For complete details, consult the [query builder documentation](/docs/{{version}}/queries#full-text-where-clauses).

<a name="semantic-vector-search"></a>
## Semantic / Vector Search

Full-text search relies on matching keywords — the words in the query must appear (in some form) in the data. Semantic search takes a fundamentally different approach: it uses vector embeddings to represent the *meaning* of text as arrays of numbers, and then finds results whose meaning is most similar to the query. For example, a search for "best wineries in Napa Valley" can surface an article titled "Top Vineyards to Visit" — even though the words don't overlap at all.

The basic workflow for vector search is: generate an embedding (a numeric array) for each piece of content and store it alongside your data, then at search time, generate an embedding for the user's query and find the stored embeddings that are closest to it in vector space. Hypervel does not generate embeddings for you; provide pre-computed vectors from your own embedding pipeline or provider.

> [!NOTE]
> Vector search is supported by PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension and MariaDB 11.7 or later.

<a name="storing-and-indexing-vectors"></a>
### Storing and Indexing Vectors

To store vector embeddings, define a `vector` column in your migration, specifying the number of dimensions in your vectors. You should also call `index` on the column to create an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index, which dramatically speeds up similarity searches on large datasets:

```php
Schema::ensureVectorExtensionExists(); // PostgreSQL only.

Schema::create('documents', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('title');
    $table->text('content');
    $table->vector('embedding', dimensions: 1536)->index();
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

The `Schema::ensureVectorExtensionExists` method ensures the `pgvector` extension is enabled on your PostgreSQL database before creating the table. Omit this call when using MariaDB.

On your Eloquent model, use the `AsVector` cast so that Hypervel automatically handles the conversion between PHP arrays and the database's vector format:

```php
use Hypervel\Database\Eloquent\Casts\AsVector;

protected function casts(): array
{
    return [
        'embedding' => AsVector::class,
    ];
}
```

For more details on vector columns and indexes, consult the [migration documentation](/docs/{{version}}/migrations#available-column-types).

<a name="querying-by-similarity"></a>
### Querying by Similarity

Once you have stored embeddings for your content, you can search for similar records using the `whereVectorSimilarTo` method. This method compares the given embedding against the stored vectors using cosine similarity, filters out results below the `minSimilarity` threshold, and automatically orders the results by relevance — with the most similar records first. The threshold should be a value between `0.0` and `1.0`, where `1.0` means the vectors are identical:

```php
$documents = Document::query()
    ->whereVectorSimilarTo('embedding', $queryEmbedding, minSimilarity: 0.4)
    ->limit(10)
    ->get();
```

For lower-level control over vector queries, the `whereVectorDistanceLessThan`, `selectVectorDistance`, and `orderByVectorDistance` methods are also available. These methods let you work directly with distance values rather than similarity scores, select the computed distance as a column in your results, or manually control the ordering. For complete details, consult the [query builder documentation](/docs/{{version}}/queries#vector-similarity-clauses).

<a name="hypervel-scout"></a>
## Hypervel Scout

The search techniques described above are all query builder methods that you call directly in your code. [Hypervel Scout](/docs/{{version}}/scout) takes a different approach: it provides a `Searchable` trait that you add to your Eloquent models, and Scout automatically keeps your search indexes in sync as records are created, updated, and deleted. This is particularly convenient when you want your models to always be searchable without manually managing index updates.

<a name="database-engine"></a>
### Database Engine

Scout's built-in database engine performs full-text and `LIKE` searches against your existing database — no external service or extra infrastructure required. Simply add the `Searchable` trait to your model and define a `toSearchableArray` method that returns the columns you want to be searchable.

You may use PHP attributes to control the search strategy for each column. `SearchUsingFullText` will use your database's full-text index, `SearchUsingPrefix` will only match from the beginning of the string (`example%`), and any columns without an attribute use a default `LIKE` strategy with wildcards on both sides (`%example%`):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Hypervel\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Hypervel\Scout\Attributes\SearchUsingFullText;
use Hypervel\Scout\Attributes\SearchUsingPrefix;
use Hypervel\Scout\Searchable;

class Article extends Model
{
    use Searchable;

    #[SearchUsingPrefix(['id'])]
    #[SearchUsingFullText(['title', 'body'])]
    public function toSearchableArray(): array
    {
        return [
            'id' => $this->id,
            'title' => $this->title,
            'body' => $this->body,
        ];
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Before specifying that a column should use full-text query constraints, ensure that the column has been assigned a [full-text index](/docs/{{version}}/migrations#available-index-types).

Once the trait is added, you may search your model using Scout's `search` method. Scout's database engine will automatically order results by relevance, even on PostgreSQL:

```php
$articles = Article::search('Hypervel')->get();
```

The database engine is a great choice when your search needs are moderate and you want the convenience of Scout's automatic index syncing without deploying an external service. It handles the most common search use cases well, including filtering, pagination, and soft-deleted record handling. For complete details, consult the [Scout documentation](/docs/{{version}}/scout#database-engine).

<a name="third-party-engines"></a>
### Third-Party Engines

Scout also supports third-party search engines such as [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com), and [Typesense](https://typesense.org). These dedicated search services offer advanced features like typo tolerance, faceted filtering, geo-search, and custom ranking rules — features that become important at very large scale or when you need a highly polished search-as-you-type experience.

Since Scout provides a unified API across all of its drivers, switching from the database engine to a third-party engine later requires minimal code changes. You may start with the database engine and migrate to a third-party service only if your application's needs outgrow what the database can provide.

For complete details on configuring third-party engines, consult the [Scout documentation](/docs/{{version}}/scout).

> [!NOTE]
> Many applications never need an external search engine. The built-in techniques described on this page cover the vast majority of use cases.

<a name="combining-techniques"></a>
## Combining Techniques

The search techniques described on this page are not mutually exclusive — combining them often produces the best results. A common pattern is to combine vector similarity with standard `where` clauses to scope semantic search to a subset of records. This is useful when you want meaning-based search but need to restrict results by ownership, category, or any other attribute:

```php
$documents = Document::query()
    ->where('team_id', $user->team_id)
    ->whereVectorSimilarTo('embedding', $queryEmbedding)
    ->limit(10)
    ->get();
```
