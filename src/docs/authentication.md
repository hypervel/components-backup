## Introduction

Many web applications provide a way for their users to authenticate with the application and "login". Implementing this feature in web applications can be a complex and potentially risky endeavor. For this reason, Hypervel strives to give you the tools you need to implement authentication quickly, securely, and easily.

At its core, Hypervel's authentication facilities are made up of "guards" and "providers". Guards define how users are authenticated for each request. For example, Hypervel ships with a `session` guard which maintains state using session storage and cookies.

Providers define how users are retrieved from your persistent storage. Hypervel ships with support for retrieving users using [Eloquent](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent) and the database query builder. However, you are free to define additional providers as needed for your application.

Your application's authentication configuration file is located at `config/auth.php`. This file contains several well-documented options for tweaking the behavior of Hypervel's authentication services.

> [!NOTE]
> Guards and providers should not be confused with "roles" and "permissions". To learn more about authorizing user actions via permissions, please refer to the [authorization](/docs/{{version}}/authorization) documentation.

### Starter Kits

Want to get started fast? Install a [Hypervel application starter kit](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits) in a fresh Hypervel application. After migrating your database, navigate your browser to `/register` or any other URL that is assigned to your application. The starter kits will take care of scaffolding your entire authentication system!

**Even if you choose not to use a starter kit in your final Hypervel application, installing a [starter kit](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits) can be a wonderful opportunity to learn how to implement all of Hypervel's authentication functionality in an actual Hypervel project.** Since the Hypervel starter kits contain authentication controllers, routes, and views for you, you can examine the code within these files to learn how Hypervel's authentication features may be implemented.

<a name="introduction-database-considerations"></a>
### Database Considerations

By default, Hypervel includes an `App\Models\User` [Eloquent model](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent) in your `app/Models` directory. This model may be used with the default Eloquent authentication driver.

If your application is not using Eloquent, you may use the `database` authentication provider which uses the Hypervel query builder.

When building the database schema for the `App\Models\User` model, make sure the password column is at least 60 characters in length. Of course, the `users` table migration that is included in new Hypervel applications already creates a column that exceeds this length.

Also, you should verify that your `users` (or equivalent) table contains a nullable, string `remember_token` column of 100 characters. This column will be used to store a token for users that select the "remember me" option when logging into your application. Again, the default `users` table migration that is included in new Hypervel applications already contains this column.

<a name="ecosystem-overview"></a>
### Ecosystem Overview

Hypervel offers several packages related to authentication. Before continuing, we'll review the general authentication ecosystem in Hypervel and discuss each package's intended purpose.

First, consider how authentication works. When using a web browser, a user will provide their username and password via a login form. If these credentials are correct, the application will store information about the authenticated user in the user's [session](/docs/{{version}}/session). A cookie issued to the browser contains the session ID so that subsequent requests to the application can associate the user with the correct session. After the session cookie is received, the application will retrieve the session data based on the session ID, note that the authentication information has been stored in the session, and will consider the user as "authenticated".

When a remote service needs to authenticate to access an API, cookies are not typically used for authentication because there is no web browser. Instead, the remote service sends an API token to the API on each request. The application may validate the incoming token against a table of valid API tokens and "authenticate" the request as being performed by the user associated with that API token.

<a name="hypervels-built-in-browser-authentication-services"></a>
#### Hypervel's Built-in Browser Authentication Services

Hypervel includes built-in authentication and session services which are typically accessed via the `Auth` and `Session` facades. These features provide cookie-based authentication for requests that are initiated from web browsers. They provide methods that allow you to verify a user's credentials and authenticate the user. In addition, these services will automatically store the proper authentication data in the user's session and issue the user's session cookie. A discussion of how to use these services is contained within this documentation.

**Application Starter Kits**

As discussed in this documentation, you can interact with these authentication services manually to build your application's own authentication layer. However, to help you get started more quickly, we have released [free starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits) that provide robust, modern scaffolding of the entire authentication layer.

<a name="hypervels-api-authentication-services"></a>
#### Hypervel's API Authentication Services

Hypervel provides optional packages to assist you in managing API tokens and authenticating requests made with API tokens, including [Sanctum](/docs/{{version}}/sanctum) and [JWT authentication](/docs/{{version}}/jwt). Please note that these libraries and Hypervel's built-in cookie based authentication libraries are not mutually exclusive. These libraries primarily focus on API token authentication while the built-in authentication services focus on cookie based browser authentication. Many applications will use both Hypervel's built-in cookie based authentication services and one of Hypervel's API authentication packages.

**Passport**

Passport is an OAuth2 authentication provider, offering a variety of OAuth2 "grant types" which allow you to issue various types of tokens. In general, this is a robust and complex package for API authentication. However, most applications do not require the complex features offered by the OAuth2 spec, which can be confusing for both users and developers. In addition, developers have been historically confused about how to authenticate SPA applications or mobile applications using OAuth2 authentication providers like Passport.

> [!NOTE]
> Hypervel's port of Passport is coming soon.

**Sanctum**

In response to the complexity of OAuth2 and developer confusion, we set out to build a simpler, more streamlined authentication package that could handle both first-party web requests from a web browser and API requests via tokens. This goal was realized with the release of [Hypervel Sanctum](/docs/{{version}}/sanctum), which should be considered the preferred and recommended authentication package for applications that will be offering a first-party web UI in addition to an API, or will be powered by a single-page application (SPA) that exists separately from the backend Hypervel application, or applications that offer a mobile client.

Hypervel Sanctum is a hybrid web / API authentication package that can manage your application's entire authentication process. This is possible because when Sanctum based applications receive a request, Sanctum will first determine if the request includes a session cookie that references an authenticated session. Sanctum accomplishes this by calling Hypervel's built-in authentication services which we discussed earlier. If the request is not being authenticated via a session cookie, Sanctum will inspect the request for an API token. If an API token is present, Sanctum will authenticate the request using that token. To learn more about this process, please consult Sanctum's ["how it works"](/docs/{{version}}/sanctum#how-it-works) documentation.

**JWT Authentication**

[Hypervel JWT](/docs/{{version}}/jwt) provides stateless bearer token authentication using signed JSON Web Tokens. JWT authentication is useful when your application needs signed tokens for API, mobile, or service-to-service requests and does not need Sanctum's database-backed personal access tokens or OAuth2 grant flows.

<a name="summary-choosing-your-stack"></a>
#### Summary and Choosing Your Stack

In summary, if your application will be accessed using a browser and you are building a monolithic Hypervel application, your application will use Hypervel's built-in authentication services.

Next, if your application offers an API that will be consumed by third parties, you will choose between [Sanctum](/docs/{{version}}/sanctum), [JWT authentication](/docs/{{version}}/jwt), or an OAuth2 server to provide API token authentication for your application. In general, Sanctum should be preferred when possible since it is a simple, complete solution for API authentication, SPA authentication, and mobile authentication, including support for "scopes" or "abilities".

If you are building a single-page application (SPA) that will be powered by a Hypervel backend, you should use [Hypervel Sanctum](/docs/{{version}}/sanctum). When using Sanctum, you will need to [manually implement your own backend authentication routes](#authenticating-users) or use [Hypervel Fortify](/docs/{{version}}/fortify) as a headless authentication backend service that provides routes and controllers for features such as registration, password reset, email verification, and more.

An OAuth2 server may be chosen when your application absolutely needs all of the features provided by the OAuth2 specification.

JWT authentication may be chosen when your application wants stateless signed bearer tokens without storing each issued token in the database.

And, if you would like to get started quickly, we are pleased to recommend [our application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits) as a quick way to start a new Hypervel application that already uses our preferred authentication stack of Hypervel's built-in authentication services.

<a name="authentication-quickstart"></a>
## Authentication Quickstart

> [!WARNING]
> This portion of the documentation discusses authenticating users via the [Hypervel application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits), which includes UI scaffolding to help you get started quickly. If you would like to integrate with Hypervel's authentication systems directly, check out the documentation on [manually authenticating users](#authenticating-users).

<a name="install-a-starter-kit"></a>
### Install a Starter Kit

First, you should [install a Hypervel application starter kit](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits). Our starter kits offer beautifully designed starting points for incorporating authentication into your fresh Hypervel application.

<a name="retrieving-the-authenticated-user"></a>
### Retrieving the Authenticated User

After creating an application from a starter kit and allowing users to register and authenticate with your application, you will often need to interact with the currently authenticated user. While handling an incoming request, you may access the authenticated user via the `Auth` facade's `user` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

// Retrieve the currently authenticated user...
$user = Auth::user();

// Retrieve the currently authenticated user's ID...
$id = Auth::id();
```

Alternatively, once a user is authenticated, you may access the authenticated user via a `Hypervel\Http\Request` instance. Remember, type-hinted classes will automatically be injected into your controller methods. By type-hinting the `Hypervel\Http\Request` object, you may gain convenient access to the authenticated user from any controller method in your application via the request's `user` method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Hypervel\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Hypervel\Http\Request;

class FlightController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Update the flight information for an existing flight.
     */
    public function update(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        $user = $request->user();

        // ...

        return redirect('/flights');
    }
}
```

<a name="determining-if-the-current-user-is-authenticated"></a>
#### Determining if the Current User is Authenticated

To determine if the user making the incoming HTTP request is authenticated, you may use the `check` method on the `Auth` facade. This method will return `true` if the user is authenticated:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

if (Auth::check()) {
    // The user is logged in...
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Even though it is possible to determine if a user is authenticated using the `check` method, you will typically use a middleware to verify that the user is authenticated before allowing the user access to certain routes / controllers. To learn more about this, check out the documentation on [protecting routes](/docs/{{version}}/authentication#protecting-routes).

<a name="user-lookup-cache"></a>
### User Lookup Cache

By default, each authenticated request that calls `Auth::user()` or `$request->user()` retrieves the user from your configured user provider. On authenticated endpoints, this can result in many repeated database queries. Hypervel's Eloquent user provider includes an optional cross-request cache for these user lookups.

The user lookup cache only caches `EloquentUserProvider::retrieveById()` results, including missing users. Credential and token lookups, such as `retrieveByCredentials()` and `retrieveByToken()`, are never cached so login attempts and "remember me" checks always read fresh data.

<a name="user-lookup-cache-configuration"></a>
#### Configuration

You may enable the cache per Eloquent provider in your application's `config/auth.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'eloquent',
        'model' => env('AUTH_MODEL', App\Models\User::class),
        'cache' => [
            'enabled' => (bool) env('AUTH_USER_CACHE_ENABLED', false),
            'store' => env('AUTH_USER_CACHE_STORE'),
            'ttl' => (int) env('AUTH_USER_CACHE_TTL', 300),
            'prefix' => env('AUTH_USER_CACHE_PREFIX', 'auth_user'),
            'tags' => null,
        ],
    ],
],
```

Omitting the `cache` record or setting it to `null` disables caching. Within a supplied record, omitted members use the displayed defaults: caching remains disabled, the default cache store is used for 300 seconds under the `auth_user` prefix, and no tags are applied. The `ttl` value must be a positive integer.

Hypervel automatically allows configured provider models and its standard Eloquent collection and pivot classes to be restored from the cache. If your cached user contains application-owned relations, custom collections or pivots, or other nested objects, declare those classes from a service provider:

```php
use App\Models\Organization;
use App\Models\Team;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Cache;

public function boot(): void
{
    Cache::allowSerializableClassesUsing(fn (): array => [
        Organization::class,
        Team::class,
    ]);
}
```

Providers constructed directly and not represented in `auth.providers` must also declare their root model. These declarations apply to stores that use PHP serialization. Native Redis serializers preserve model types but bypass this class policy. See [Serializable Cached Objects](/docs/{{version}}/cache#serializable-cached-objects) for more information.

<a name="user-lookup-cache-stores"></a>
#### Cache Stores

When `store` is `null`, Hypervel uses your default cache store. For a single Redis-backed deployment, you may enable the cache like this:

```ini
AUTH_USER_CACHE_ENABLED=true
AUTH_USER_CACHE_STORE=redis
```

Supported stores are `redis`, `database`, `file`, and `swoole`. The selected store must provide atomic locks. Storage, stack, array, worker-array, null, session, and failover stores are rejected. A cache stack may retain a user in an upper layer on another worker or node after the entry has been invalidated.

The `swoole` and `file` stores are available only within their shared local scope. For a multi-node application, choose a cache store whose values and locks are shared by every application node.

Cache hits do not acquire a lock or query the database. On a miss, Hypervel coordinates the database read and cache write with the user's invalidation lock. Cache fills use the write database connection so a committed user change is not replaced by data read from a lagging replica.

For Redis, `SERIALIZER_NONE`, native PHP, and available igbinary serializers preserve model types. Msgpack is accepted only with `msgpack.php_only=1`. JSON, non-PHP msgpack, and unknown modes are rejected because they can return arrays instead of models. Native serializers bypass `cache.serializable_classes`; use `SERIALIZER_NONE` when class-policy enforcement is required.

Auth cache configuration is read during process startup and must not be changed while a worker is serving requests.

<a name="user-lookup-cache-custom-keys"></a>
#### Custom Cache Keys

The default cache key format is `{prefix}:{user-model-fqcn}:{identifier}`, such as `auth_user:App\Models\User:42`. Including the model class prevents collisions when different guards use different user models.

If the same user identifier can resolve to different records based on request-scoped application state, you may register a cache key resolver in a service provider:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use App\Support\CurrentWorkspace;
use Hypervel\Auth\EloquentUserProvider;
use Hypervel\Database\Eloquent\Model;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    EloquentUserProvider::resolveUserCacheKeyUsing(
        function (mixed $identifier, string $model, ?Model $user): string {
            if (! is_a($model, User::class, true)) {
                return (string) $identifier;
            }

            $workspaceId = $user?->workspace_id ?? CurrentWorkspace::id();

            return $workspaceId . ':' . $identifier;
        },
    );
}
```

In this example, `CurrentWorkspace` is an application-owned class that reads request-scoped state. The resolver keeps each workspace's `User` cache entries separate while leaving other provider models unchanged. It controls only the identifier segment of the key; the cache prefix and user model class are still included automatically.

The resolver receives the identifier and provider model class. When a user is saved or deleted, automatic invalidation also provides the user model. Lookups and manual invalidation provide `null`.

<a name="user-lookup-cache-invalidation"></a>
#### Invalidating Cached Users

Cached users are invalidated automatically after the user model's save or delete transaction commits. A rollback leaves the existing committed cache entry in place. This includes provider writes such as "remember me" token updates and automatic password rehashing, because those operations save the Eloquent model. Entries that are not cleared expire after the configured `ttl`.

Writes that bypass Eloquent model events, such as raw queries, mass updates, or pivot table changes for roles and permissions, should clear the cached user manually:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

Auth::clearUserCache($user->getAuthIdentifier());

// Clear using a specific guard's provider...
Auth::clearUserCache($admin->getAuthIdentifier(), guard: 'admin');
```

`clearUserCache` accepts the same identifier as `retrieveById`, which is normally the user's primary key. When the guard argument is omitted, the current default guard is used.

Manual invalidation follows the provider model's database connection. When called inside a transaction, the cache entry remains unchanged until the outer transaction commits and is left in place if the transaction rolls back. Code that needs the uncommitted value should continue using the model or query result it already owns instead of reading through the shared authentication cache.

Invalidation waits for any in-flight cache fill on the same user. When a transaction scheduled the invalidation and its lock cannot be acquired, the cache lock timeout is thrown from the commit after the database write has committed, rather than leaving the stale user cached.

If `withQuery()` eager-loads relations, the first uncached lookup stores that graph. Declare every application relation and custom container class so later cache hits restore the complete shape.

If multiple guards share the same Eloquent provider and user model, one clear call against any of those guards clears that provider's cache keyspace. If different guards use different user models, pass the guard name so Hypervel can clear the correct provider. When a custom key resolver is registered, `clearUserCache` uses that same resolver with a `null` user model and clears the cache entry for the current request context. To clear the same identifier in several application contexts, call `clearUserCache` once for each context.

If the selected guard does not use an Eloquent user provider, or if caching is disabled for that provider, `clearUserCache` does nothing.

<a name="user-lookup-cache-bulk-invalidation"></a>
#### Bulk Invalidation

If you need to clear many cached users at once, use a dedicated cache store for auth, point `AUTH_USER_CACHE_STORE` at that store, and flush it:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Cache;

Cache::store('auth')->flush();
```

For narrower bulk flushes, configure a Redis cache store in `any` tag mode and add static tags to the provider's cache configuration:

```php
// config/cache.php
'stores' => [
    'auth' => [
        'driver' => 'redis',
        'connection' => 'auth',
        'tag_mode' => 'any',
    ],
],

// config/auth.php
'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        // ...
        'cache' => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'store' => 'auth',
            'ttl' => 300,
            'prefix' => 'auth_user',
            'tags' => ['auth_users'],
        ],
    ],
],
```

Then flush the tagged entries:

```php
Cache::store('auth')->tags(['auth_users'])->flush();
```

Auth cache tags require a Redis store with `tag_mode` set to `any`. The default Redis tag mode is `all`, so use a separate Redis store when enabling auth cache tags.

Store and tag flushes take effect immediately. They are not delayed until a database transaction commits and do not coordinate with individual cache fills. Use exact `clearUserCache()` invalidation for a database mutation that must become visible atomically after commit.

You may also add dynamic tags based on request-scoped application state. This is useful when every cached user should keep a broad static tag, such as `auth_users`, plus a narrower tag for the current workspace:

```php
use App\Support\CurrentWorkspace;
use Hypervel\Auth\EloquentUserProvider;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    EloquentUserProvider::resolveUserCacheTagsUsing(
        fn (): array => ['workspace:' . CurrentWorkspace::id()],
    );
}
```

Here, `CurrentWorkspace` is the same application-owned class shown in the custom cache key example. Dynamic tags are only applied when static `cache.tags` are configured. Without static tags, the resolver is ignored and writes use the untagged cache. Per-user invalidation via `Auth::clearUserCache()` still works when tags are configured because it invalidates the exact cache key.

You may then clear the cached users for one workspace:

```php
use App\Support\CurrentWorkspace;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Cache;

Cache::store('auth')->tags(['workspace:' . CurrentWorkspace::id()])->flush();
```

<a name="user-lookup-cache-provider-api"></a>
#### Low-Level Provider API

If you instantiate `EloquentUserProvider` yourself, the provider exposes lower-level cache APIs:

```php
public function enableCache(?string $storeName, int $ttl = 300, ?string $prefix = 'auth_user', ?array $tags = null): static;
public function isCacheEnabled(): bool;
public function clearUserCache(mixed $identifier): void;

public static function resolveUserCacheKeyUsing(Closure $callback): void;
public static function resolveUserCacheTagsUsing(Closure $callback): void;
```

Most applications should prefer the `config/auth.php` configuration and the `Auth::clearUserCache()` facade method.

<a name="protecting-routes"></a>
### Protecting Routes

[Route middleware](/docs/{{version}}/middleware) can be used to only allow authenticated users to access a given route. Hypervel ships with an `auth` middleware, which is a [middleware alias](/docs/{{version}}/middleware#middleware-aliases) for the `Hypervel\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate` class. Since this middleware is already aliased internally by Hypervel, all you need to do is attach the middleware to a route definition:

```php
Route::get('/flights', function () {
    // Only authenticated users may access this route...
})->middleware('auth');
```

<a name="redirecting-unauthenticated-users"></a>
#### Redirecting Unauthenticated Users

When the `auth` middleware detects an unauthenticated user, it will redirect the user to the `login` [named route](/docs/{{version}}/routing#named-routes). You may modify this behavior using the `redirectGuestsTo` method within your application's `bootstrap/app.php` file:

```php
use Hypervel\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;
use Hypervel\Http\Request;

->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
    $middleware->redirectGuestsTo('/login');

    // Using a closure...
    $middleware->redirectGuestsTo(fn (Request $request) => route('login'));

    // Disable redirects for unauthenticated users...
    $middleware->redirectGuestsTo(null);
})
```

Packages and service providers may configure the same redirect through the `Auth` facade:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

public function boot(): void
{
    Auth::redirectGuestsTo('/login');

    // Using a closure...
    Auth::redirectGuestsTo(fn (Request $request) => route('login'));
}
```

Redirect paths may be strings or request-aware callbacks. Passing `null` through either high-level API disables the guest redirect. Non-JSON requests then receive an empty 401 response, while requests that expect JSON continue to receive a JSON 401 response. The callback registration is boot-time worker-lifetime state, but the callback result is computed for each request.

Configure these redirects from `bootstrap/app.php` with the middleware configurator, or from a service provider / package with the `Auth` facade. Both high-level APIs configure the same global redirect callbacks, so an application should generally choose one style for each redirect. If both high-level APIs are called for the same redirect, the most recent registration wins.

Under the hood, the `auth` middleware throws a `Hypervel\Auth\AuthenticationException` when a user is unauthenticated. This exception is converted into a redirect (or a 401 JSON response for API requests) by your application's exception handler. If you need lower-level control beyond the high-level APIs, you may override the `unauthenticated` method in your exception handler or configure the low-level redirect callbacks directly on the relevant middleware or exception classes.

<a name="redirecting-authenticated-users"></a>
#### Redirecting Authenticated Users

When the `guest` middleware detects an authenticated user, it will redirect the user to the `dashboard` or `home` named route. You may modify this behavior using the `redirectUsersTo` method within your application's `bootstrap/app.php` file:

```php
use Hypervel\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;
use Hypervel\Http\Request;

->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
    $middleware->redirectUsersTo('/panel');

    // Using a closure...
    $middleware->redirectUsersTo(fn (Request $request) => route('panel'));
})
```

Packages and service providers may configure the same redirect through the `Auth` facade:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

public function boot(): void
{
    Auth::redirectUsersTo('/panel');

    // Using a closure...
    Auth::redirectUsersTo(fn (Request $request) => route('panel'));
}
```

When the `guest` middleware names a guard and the request continues, that guard becomes the current default guard for the request. If multiple guards are listed, the first guard is selected.

You may use the `RedirectIfAuthenticated` middleware's `using` method as an alternative to a middleware alias. For example, the following is equivalent to `guest:admin,web`:

```php
use Hypervel\Auth\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/admin/login', fn () => view('auth.login'))
    ->middleware(RedirectIfAuthenticated::using('admin', 'web'));
```

<a name="specifying-a-guard"></a>
#### Specifying a Guard

When attaching the `auth` middleware to a route, you may also specify which "guard" should be used to authenticate the user. The guard specified should correspond to one of the keys in the `guards` array of your `auth.php` configuration file:

```php
Route::get('/flights', function () {
    // Only authenticated users may access this route...
})->middleware('auth:admin');
```

Guards that send password reset links declare their password broker with the `passwords` key. Multi-guard applications should set this per guard. On guest routes such as login and password reset requests, naming the guard on the `guest` middleware selects it for the request — `guest:admin` makes `admin` the current guard, so authentication, policies, and password reset flows all follow the same user type. For guest routes that do not use the `guest` middleware, apply `auth.guard:admin` instead:

```php
'guards' => [
    'web' => [
        'driver' => 'session',
        'provider' => 'users',
        'passwords' => 'users',
    ],

    'admin' => [
        'driver' => 'session',
        'provider' => 'admins',
        'passwords' => 'admins',
    ],
],
```

### Login Throttling

If you are using one of our [application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits), rate limiting will automatically be applied to login attempts. By default, the user will not be able to login for one minute if they fail to provide the correct credentials after several attempts. The throttling is unique to the current guard, the user's username / email address, and their IP address.

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to rate limit other routes in your application, check out the [rate limiting documentation](/docs/{{version}}/routing#rate-limiting).

<a name="authenticating-users"></a>
## Manually Authenticating Users

You are not required to use the authentication scaffolding included with Hypervel's [application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits). If you choose not to use this scaffolding, you will need to manage user authentication using the Hypervel authentication classes directly. Don't worry, it's a cinch!

We will access Hypervel's authentication services via the `Auth` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades), so we'll need to make sure to import the `Auth` facade at the top of the class. Next, let's check out the `attempt` method. The `attempt` method is normally used to handle authentication attempts from your application's "login" form. If authentication is successful, you should regenerate the user's [session](/docs/{{version}}/session) to prevent [session fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

class LoginController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Handle an authentication attempt.
     */
    public function authenticate(Request $request): RedirectResponse
    {
        $credentials = $request->validate([
            'email' => ['required', 'email'],
            'password' => ['required'],
        ]);

        if (Auth::attempt($credentials)) {
            $request->session()->regenerate();

            return redirect()->intended('dashboard');
        }

        return back()->withErrors([
            'email' => 'The provided credentials do not match our records.',
        ])->onlyInput('email');
    }
}
```

The `attempt` method accepts an array of key / value pairs as its first argument. The values in the array will be used to find the user in your database table. So, in the example above, the user will be retrieved by the value of the `email` column. If the user is found, the hashed password stored in the database will be compared with the `password` value passed to the method via the array. You should not hash the incoming request's `password` value, since the framework will automatically hash the value before comparing it to the hashed password in the database. An authenticated session will be started for the user if the two hashed passwords match.

Remember, Hypervel's authentication services will retrieve users from your database based on your authentication guard's "provider" configuration. In the default `config/auth.php` configuration file, the Eloquent user provider is specified and it is instructed to use the `App\Models\User` model when retrieving users. You may change these values within your configuration file based on the needs of your application.

The `attempt` method will return `true` if authentication was successful. Otherwise, `false` will be returned.

The `intended` method provided by Hypervel's redirector will redirect the user to the URL they were attempting to access before being intercepted by the authentication middleware. A fallback URI may be given to this method in case the intended destination is not available.

<a name="specifying-additional-conditions"></a>
#### Specifying Additional Conditions

If you wish, you may also add extra query conditions to the authentication query in addition to the user's email and password. To accomplish this, we may simply add the query conditions to the array passed to the `attempt` method. For example, we may verify that the user is marked as "active":

```php
if (Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password, 'active' => 1])) {
    // Authentication was successful...
}
```

For complex query conditions, you may provide a closure in your array of credentials. This closure will be invoked with the query instance, allowing you to customize the query based on your application's needs:

```php
use Hypervel\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

if (Auth::attempt([
    'email' => $email,
    'password' => $password,
    fn (Builder $query) => $query->has('activeSubscription'),
])) {
    // Authentication was successful...
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> In these examples, `email` is not a required option, it is merely used as an example. You should use whatever column name corresponds to a "username" in your database table.

The `attemptWhen` method, which receives a closure as its second argument, may be used to perform more extensive inspection of the potential user before actually authenticating the user. The closure receives the potential user and should return `true` or `false` to indicate if the user may be authenticated:

```php
if (Auth::attemptWhen([
    'email' => $email,
    'password' => $password,
], function (User $user) {
    return $user->isNotBanned();
})) {
    // Authentication was successful...
}
```

<a name="accessing-specific-guard-instances"></a>
#### Accessing Specific Guard Instances

Via the `Auth` facade's `guard` method, you may specify which guard instance you would like to utilize when authenticating the user. This allows you to manage authentication for separate parts of your application using entirely separate authenticatable models or user tables.

The guard name passed to the `guard` method should correspond to one of the guards configured in your `auth.php` configuration file:

```php
if (Auth::guard('admin')->attempt($credentials)) {
    // ...
}
```

The `guard`, `shouldUse`, and `setDefaultDriver` methods also accept enum cases. Backed enums use their values, while unit enums use their case names:

```php
use App\Enums\Guard;

$user = Auth::guard(Guard::Admin)->user();
```

<a name="remembering-users"></a>
### Remembering Users

Many web applications provide a "remember me" checkbox on their login form. If you would like to provide "remember me" functionality in your application, you may pass a boolean value as the second argument to the `attempt` method.

When this value is `true`, Hypervel will keep the user authenticated until the "remember me" cookie expires or they manually log out. By default, the cookie is valid for 400 days. Your `users` table must include the string `remember_token` column, which will be used to store the "remember me" token. The `users` table migration included with new Hypervel applications already includes this column:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

if (Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password], $remember)) {
    // The user is being remembered...
}
```

Existing remember cookies stop working when a user's password hash changes or when the application key is rotated.

You may customize the cookie lifetime for a session guard using the `remember` option in your application's `config/auth.php` configuration file. The value is expressed in minutes. If this option is omitted or `null`, Hypervel uses the built-in 400-day lifetime. For example, the following configuration uses a 30-day lifetime:

```php
'guards' => [
    'web' => [
        'driver' => 'session',
        'provider' => 'users',
        'remember' => 60 * 24 * 30,
    ],
],
```

If your application offers "remember me" functionality, you may use the `viaRemember` method to determine if the currently authenticated user was authenticated using the "remember me" cookie:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

if (Auth::viaRemember()) {
    // ...
}
```

<a name="other-authentication-methods"></a>
### Other Authentication Methods

<a name="authenticate-a-user-instance"></a>
#### Authenticate a User Instance

If you need to set an existing user instance as the currently authenticated user, you may pass the user instance to the `Auth` facade's `login` method. The given user instance must be an implementation of the `Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable` [contract](/docs/{{version}}/contracts). The `App\Models\User` model included with Hypervel already implements this interface. This method of authentication is useful when you already have a valid user instance, such as directly after a user registers with your application:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

Auth::login($user);
```

You may pass a boolean value as the second argument to the `login` method. This value indicates if "remember me" functionality is desired for the authenticated session. The user will remain authenticated until the "remember me" cookie expires or they manually log out of the application:

```php
Auth::login($user, $remember = true);
```

If needed, you may specify an authentication guard before calling the `login` method:

```php
Auth::guard('admin')->login($user);
```

<a name="authenticate-a-user-by-id"></a>
#### Authenticate a User by ID

To authenticate a user using their database record's primary key, you may use the `loginUsingId` method. This method accepts the primary key of the user you wish to authenticate:

```php
Auth::loginUsingId(1);
```

You may pass a boolean value to the `remember` argument of the `loginUsingId` method. This value indicates if "remember me" functionality is desired for the authenticated session. The user will remain authenticated until the "remember me" cookie expires or they manually log out of the application:

```php
Auth::loginUsingId(1, remember: true);
```

<a name="authenticate-a-user-once"></a>
#### Authenticate a User Once

You may use the `once` method to authenticate a user with the application for a single request. No sessions or cookies will be utilized when calling this method, and the `Login` event will not be dispatched:

```php
if (Auth::once($credentials)) {
    // ...
}
```

<a name="http-basic-authentication"></a>
## HTTP Basic Authentication

[HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) provides a quick way to authenticate users of your application without setting up a dedicated "login" page. To get started, attach the `auth.basic` [middleware](/docs/{{version}}/middleware) to a route. The `auth.basic` middleware is included with the Hypervel framework, so you do not need to define it:

```php
Route::get('/profile', function () {
    // Only authenticated users may access this route...
})->middleware('auth.basic');
```

Once the middleware has been attached to the route, you will automatically be prompted for credentials when accessing the route in your browser. By default, the `auth.basic` middleware will assume the `email` column on your `users` database table is the user's "username".

<a name="stateless-http-basic-authentication"></a>
### Stateless HTTP Basic Authentication

You may also use HTTP Basic Authentication without setting a user identifier cookie in the session. This is primarily helpful if you choose to use HTTP Authentication to authenticate requests to your application's API. To accomplish this, [define a middleware](/docs/{{version}}/middleware) that calls the `onceBasic` method. If no response is returned by the `onceBasic` method, the request may be passed further into the application:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class AuthenticateOnceWithBasicAuth
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Closure(\Hypervel\Http\Request): (\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response)  $next
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        return Auth::onceBasic() ?: $next($request);
    }

}
```

Next, attach the middleware to a route:

```php
Route::get('/api/user', function () {
    // Only authenticated users may access this route...
})->middleware(AuthenticateOnceWithBasicAuth::class);
```

<a name="logging-out"></a>
## Logging Out

To manually log users out of your application, you may use the `logout` method provided by the `Auth` facade. This will remove the authentication information from the user's session so that subsequent requests are not authenticated.

In addition to calling the `logout` method, it is recommended that you invalidate the user's session and regenerate their [CSRF token](/docs/{{version}}/csrf). After logging the user out, you would typically redirect the user to the root of your application:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Http\RedirectResponse;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

/**
 * Log the user out of the application.
 */
public function logout(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    Auth::logout();

    $request->session()->invalidate();

    $request->session()->regenerateToken();

    return redirect('/');
}
```

<a name="invalidating-sessions-on-other-devices"></a>
### Invalidating Sessions on Other Devices

Hypervel also provides a mechanism for invalidating and "logging out" a user's sessions that are active on other devices without invalidating the session on their current device. This feature is typically utilized when a user is changing or updating their password and you would like to invalidate sessions on other devices while keeping the current device authenticated.

Before getting started, you should make sure that the `Hypervel\Session\Middleware\AuthenticateSession` middleware is included on the routes that should receive session authentication. Typically, you should place this middleware on a route group definition so that it can be applied to the majority of your application's routes. By default, the `AuthenticateSession` middleware may be attached to a route using the `auth.session` [middleware alias](/docs/{{version}}/middleware#middleware-aliases):

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'auth.session'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

Custom guards used with `auth.session` must provide a `hashPasswordForCookie` method that returns an HMAC of the password hash and use the same value when creating remember cookies. Extending `Hypervel\Auth\SessionGuard` provides this behavior.

Then, you may use the `logoutOtherDevices` method provided by the `Auth` facade. This method requires the user to confirm their current password, which your application should accept through an input form:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

Auth::logoutOtherDevices($currentPassword);
```

When the `logoutOtherDevices` method is invoked, the user's other sessions will be invalidated entirely, meaning they will be "logged out" of all guards they were previously authenticated by.

<a name="password-confirmation"></a>
## Password Confirmation

While building your application, you may occasionally have actions that should require the user to confirm their password before the action is performed or before the user is redirected to a sensitive area of the application. Hypervel includes built-in middleware to make this process a breeze. Implementing this feature will require you to define two routes: one route to display a view asking the user to confirm their password and another route to confirm that the password is valid and redirect the user to their intended destination.

> [!NOTE]
> The following documentation discusses how to integrate with Hypervel's password confirmation features directly; however, if you would like to get started more quickly, the [Hypervel application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits) include support for this feature!

<a name="password-confirmation-configuration"></a>
### Configuration

After confirming their password, a user will not be asked to confirm their password again for three hours. However, you may configure the length of time before the user is re-prompted for their password by changing the value of the `password_timeout` configuration value within your application's `config/auth.php` configuration file. Password confirmation is scoped to the current guard, so confirming under one guard never satisfies the `password.confirm` middleware under another guard. Individual guards may override the timeout with a `password_timeout` key in their guard configuration. If the guard option is omitted or `null`, the application-wide timeout is used.

<a name="password-confirmation-routing"></a>
### Routing

<a name="the-password-confirmation-form"></a>
#### The Password Confirmation Form

First, we will define a route to display a view that requests the user to confirm their password:

```php
Route::get('/confirm-password', function () {
    return view('auth.confirm-password');
})->middleware('auth')->name('password.confirm');
```

As you might expect, the view that is returned by this route should have a form containing a `password` field. In addition, feel free to include text within the view that explains that the user is entering a protected area of the application and must confirm their password.

<a name="confirming-the-password"></a>
#### Confirming the Password

Next, we will define a route that will handle the form request from the "confirm password" view. This route will be responsible for validating the password and redirecting the user to their intended destination:

```php
use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Hash;

Route::post('/confirm-password', function (Request $request) {
    if (! Hash::check($request->password, $request->user()->password)) {
        return back()->withErrors([
            'password' => ['The provided password does not match our records.']
        ]);
    }

    $request->session()->passwordConfirmed();

    return redirect()->intended();
})->middleware(['auth', 'throttle:6,1']);
```

Before moving on, let's examine this route in more detail. First, the request's `password` field is determined to actually match the authenticated user's password. If the password is valid, we need to inform Hypervel's session that the user has confirmed their password. The `passwordConfirmed` method will set a timestamp in the user's session that Hypervel can use to determine when the user last confirmed their password. Finally, we can redirect the user to their intended destination.

<a name="password-confirmation-protecting-routes"></a>
### Protecting Routes

You should ensure that any route that performs an action which requires recent password confirmation is assigned the `password.confirm` middleware. This middleware is included with the default installation of Hypervel and will automatically store the user's intended destination in the session so that the user may be redirected to that location after confirming their password. After storing the user's intended destination in the session, the middleware will redirect the user to the `password.confirm` [named route](/docs/{{version}}/routing#named-routes):

```php
Route::get('/settings', function () {
    // ...
})->middleware(['password.confirm']);

Route::post('/settings', function () {
    // ...
})->middleware(['password.confirm']);
```

<a name="adding-custom-guards"></a>
## Adding Custom Guards

You may define your own authentication guards using the `extend` method on the `Auth` facade. You should place your call to the `extend` method within a [service provider](/docs/{{version}}/providers). Since Hypervel already ships with an `AppServiceProvider`, we can place the code in that provider:

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to authenticate requests using JSON Web Tokens, use Hypervel's [JWT authentication](/docs/{{version}}/jwt) package. This section is for custom authentication systems that are not already provided by Hypervel.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Services\Auth\TokenGuard;
use Hypervel\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // ...

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Auth::extend('token', function (Application $app, string $name, array $config) {
            // Return an instance of Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\Guard...

            return new TokenGuard(Auth::createUserProvider($config['provider']));
        });
    }
}
```

As you can see in the example above, the callback passed to the `extend` method should return an implementation of `Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\Guard`. This interface contains a few methods you will need to implement to define a custom guard. Once your custom guard has been defined, you may reference the guard in the `guards` configuration of your `auth.php` configuration file:

```php
'guards' => [
    'api' => [
        'driver' => 'token',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
],
```

<a name="closure-request-guards"></a>
### Closure Request Guards

The simplest way to implement a custom, HTTP request based authentication system is by using the `Auth::viaRequest` method. This method allows you to quickly define your authentication process using a single closure.

To get started, call the `Auth::viaRequest` method within the `boot` method of your application's `AppServiceProvider`. The `viaRequest` method accepts an authentication driver name as its first argument. This name can be any string that describes your custom guard. The second argument passed to the method should be a closure that receives the incoming HTTP request and returns a user instance or, if authentication fails, `null`:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Auth::viaRequest('custom-token', function (Request $request) {
        return User::where('token', (string) $request->token)->first();
    });
}
```

Once your custom authentication driver has been defined, you may configure it as a driver within the `guards` configuration of your `auth.php` configuration file:

```php
'guards' => [
    'api' => [
        'driver' => 'custom-token',
    ],
],
```

Finally, you may reference the guard when assigning the authentication middleware to a route:

```php
Route::middleware('auth:api')->group(function () {
    // ...
});
```

<a name="adding-custom-user-providers"></a>
## Adding Custom User Providers

If you are not using a traditional relational database to store your users, you will need to extend Hypervel with your own authentication user provider. We will use the `provider` method on the `Auth` facade to define a custom user provider. The user provider resolver should return an implementation of `Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Auth\ExternalDirectoryUserProvider;
use App\Services\ExternalDirectory;
use Hypervel\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // ...

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Auth::provider('external-directory', function (Application $app, array $config) {
            // Return an instance of Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider...

            return new ExternalDirectoryUserProvider($app->make(ExternalDirectory::class));
        });
    }
}
```

Database-backed providers that remain cached between requests should accept a `Hypervel\Database\ConnectionResolverInterface` and keep the configured connection name separately. Resolve the connection when each database operation begins instead of constructing the provider with `$app->make('db')->connection(...)`; a pooled connection belongs to the coroutine that borrowed it.

After you have registered the provider using the `provider` method, you may switch to the new user provider in your `auth.php` configuration file. First, define a `provider` that uses your new driver:

```php
'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'external-directory',
    ],
],
```

Finally, you may reference this provider in your `guards` configuration:

```php
'guards' => [
    'web' => [
        'driver' => 'session',
        'provider' => 'users',
        'passwords' => 'users',
    ],
],
```

<a name="the-user-provider-contract"></a>
### The User Provider Contract

`Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider` implementations are responsible for fetching a `Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable` implementation out of a persistent storage system, such as MySQL, LDAP, or an external identity service. These two interfaces allow the Hypervel authentication mechanisms to continue functioning regardless of how the user data is stored or what type of class is used to represent the authenticated user:

Let's take a look at the `Hypervel\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace Hypervel\Contracts\Auth;

use SensitiveParameter;

interface UserProvider
{
    public function retrieveById(mixed $identifier): ?Authenticatable;
    public function retrieveByToken(mixed $identifier, #[SensitiveParameter] string $token): ?Authenticatable;
    public function updateRememberToken(Authenticatable $user, #[SensitiveParameter] string $token): void;
    public function retrieveByCredentials(#[SensitiveParameter] array $credentials): ?Authenticatable;
    public function validateCredentials(Authenticatable $user, #[SensitiveParameter] array $credentials): bool;
    public function rehashPasswordIfRequired(Authenticatable $user, #[SensitiveParameter] array $credentials, bool $force = false): void;
}
```

The `retrieveById` function typically receives a key representing the user, such as an auto-incrementing ID from a MySQL database. The `Authenticatable` implementation matching the ID should be retrieved and returned by the method.

The `retrieveByToken` function retrieves a user by their unique `$identifier` and "remember me" `$token`, typically stored in a database column like `remember_token`. As with the previous method, the `Authenticatable` implementation with a matching token value should be returned by this method.

The `updateRememberToken` method updates the `$user` instance's `remember_token` with the new `$token`. A fresh token is assigned to users on a successful "remember me" authentication attempt or when the user is logging out.

The `retrieveByCredentials` method receives the array of credentials passed to the `Auth::attempt` method when attempting to authenticate with an application. The method should then "query" the underlying persistent storage for the user matching those credentials. Typically, this method will run a query with a "where" condition that searches for a user record with a "username" matching the value of `$credentials['username']`. The method should return an implementation of `Authenticatable`. **This method should not attempt to do any password validation or authentication.**

The `validateCredentials` method should compare the given `$user` with the `$credentials` to authenticate the user. For example, this method will typically use the `Hash::check` method to compare the value of `$user->getAuthPassword()` to the value of `$credentials['password']`. This method should return `true` or `false` indicating whether the password is valid.

The `rehashPasswordIfRequired` method should rehash the given `$user`'s password if required and supported. For example, this method will typically use the `Hash::needsRehash` method to determine if the `$credentials['password']` value needs to be rehashed. If the password needs to be rehashed, the method should use the `Hash::make` method to rehash the password and update the user's record in the underlying persistent storage.

<a name="the-authenticatable-contract"></a>
### The Authenticatable Contract

Now that we have explored each of the methods on the `UserProvider`, let's take a look at the `Authenticatable` contract. Remember, user providers should return implementations of this interface from the `retrieveById`, `retrieveByToken`, and `retrieveByCredentials` methods:

```php
<?php

namespace Hypervel\Contracts\Auth;

interface Authenticatable
{
    public function getAuthIdentifierName(): string;
    public function getAuthIdentifier(): mixed;
    public function getAuthPasswordName(): string;
    public function getAuthPassword(): ?string;
    public function getRememberToken(): ?string;
    public function setRememberToken(string $value): void;
    public function getRememberTokenName(): string;
}
```

This interface is simple. The `getAuthIdentifierName` method should return the name of the "primary key" column for the user and the `getAuthIdentifier` method should return the "primary key" of the user. When using a MySQL back-end, this would likely be the auto-incrementing primary key assigned to the user record. The `getAuthPasswordName` method should return the name of the user's password column. The `getAuthPassword` method should return the user's hashed password.

This interface allows the authentication system to work with any "user" class, regardless of what ORM or storage abstraction layer you are using. By default, Hypervel includes an `App\Models\User` class in the `app/Models` directory which implements this interface.

<a name="automatic-password-rehashing"></a>
## Automatic Password Rehashing

Hypervel's default password hashing algorithm is bcrypt. The "work factor" for bcrypt hashes can be adjusted via your application's `config/hashing.php` configuration file or the `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` environment variable.

Typically, the bcrypt work factor should be increased over time as CPU / GPU processing power increases. If you increase the bcrypt work factor for your application, Hypervel will gracefully and automatically rehash user passwords as users authenticate with your application via Hypervel's starter kits or when you [manually authenticate users](#authenticating-users) via the `attempt` method.

Typically, automatic password rehashing should not disrupt your application; however, you may disable this behavior by publishing the `hashing` configuration file:

```shell
php artisan config:publish hashing
```

Once the configuration file has been published, you may set the `rehash_on_login` configuration value to `false`:

```php
'rehash_on_login' => false,
```

## Events

Hypervel dispatches a variety of [events](/docs/{{version}}/events) during the authentication process. You may [define listeners](/docs/{{version}}/events) for any of the following events:
