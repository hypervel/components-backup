## Introduction

Artisan is the command line interface included with Hypervel. Artisan exists at the root of your application as the `artisan` script and provides a number of helpful commands you can use while building your application. To view a list of all available Artisan commands, you may use the `list` command:

```shell
php artisan list
```

Every command also includes a "help" screen which displays and describes the command's available arguments and options. To view a help screen, precede the name of the command with `help`:

```shell
php artisan help migrate
```

<a name="tinker"></a>
### Tinker (REPL)

[Hypervel Tinker](https://github.com/hypervel/tinker) is a powerful REPL for the Hypervel framework, powered by the [PsySH](https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh) package.

<a name="installation"></a>
#### Installation

All Hypervel applications include Tinker by default. However, you may install Tinker using Composer if you have previously removed it from your application:

```shell
composer require hypervel/tinker
```

<a name="usage"></a>
#### Usage

Tinker allows you to interact with your entire Hypervel application on the command line, including your Eloquent models, jobs, events, and more. To enter the Tinker environment, run the `tinker` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan tinker
```

You may also execute code without opening the interactive shell using the `--execute` option:

```shell
php artisan tinker --execute='echo App\Models\User::count();'
```

The command returns an exit status of zero when the code completes successfully. If the code calls `exit`, Artisan returns the requested exit status. Uncaught exceptions return an exit status of one.

You may pass one or more PHP files to load before Tinker executes your code:

```shell
php artisan tinker bootstrap.php --execute='echo $message;'
```

If an included file cannot be loaded, Tinker reports the error and continues. The command's exit status still reflects the executed code.

You can publish Tinker's configuration file using the `vendor:publish` command and Tinker's publish tag:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=tinker-config
```

You may also publish the configuration file by provider:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Hypervel\Tinker\TinkerServiceProvider"
```

> [!WARNING]
> The `dispatch` helper function and `dispatch` method on the `Dispatchable` class depend on garbage collection to place the job on the queue. Therefore, when using Tinker, you should use `Bus::dispatch` or `Queue::push` to dispatch jobs.

> [!NOTE]
> Hypervel Tinker disables PsySH's process forking because `pcntl_fork` is incompatible with Swoole's coroutine scheduler.

<a name="command-allow-list"></a>
#### Command Allow List

Tinker utilizes an "allow" list to determine which Artisan commands are allowed to be run within its shell. By default, you may run the `clear-compiled`, `down`, `env`, `inspire`, `migrate`, `migrate:install`, `up`, and `optimize` commands. If you would like to allow more commands you may add them to the `commands` array in your `tinker.php` configuration file:

```php
'commands' => [
    // App\Console\Commands\ExampleCommand::class,
],
```

<a name="classes-that-should-not-be-aliased"></a>
#### Class Aliases

Tinker does not automatically alias classes from your application's dependencies. To allow a specific vendor class or namespace, add its fully qualified name to the `alias` array of your `tinker.php` configuration file:

```php
'alias' => [
    'Vendor\Package',
],
```

You may also prevent application classes from being aliased by adding them to the `dont_alias` array:

```php
'dont_alias' => [
    App\Models\User::class,
],
```

<a name="custom-tinker-casters"></a>
#### Custom Casters

Tinker uses Symfony VarDumper casters to present objects in the shell. You may register custom casters in your `tinker.php` configuration file:

```php
'casters' => [
    App\Money::class => App\Tinker\MoneyCaster::class . '::cast',
],
```

Application casters take precedence over Tinker's default casters.

<a name="trusting-project-configuration"></a>
#### Trusting Project Configuration

PsySH may load project-specific configuration from a local `.psysh.php` file. By default, Tinker asks you to trust an unfamiliar project before loading this file. During non-interactive execution, untrusted project configuration is skipped. If PsySH suggests the `--trust-project` option, use the environment variable below instead; Artisan does not expose this option.

If Tinker only runs from a trusted working directory, you may set the `trust_project` option in your `tinker.php` configuration file to `always`. You may also trust the project for a single command using the `TINKER_TRUST_PROJECT` environment variable:

```shell
TINKER_TRUST_PROJECT=always php artisan tinker --execute='echo App\Models\User::count();'
```

To prevent Tinker from loading local project configuration, set `trust_project` to `never`.

<a name="writing-commands"></a>
## Writing Commands

In addition to the commands provided with Artisan, you may build your own custom commands. Commands are typically stored in the `app/Console/Commands` directory; however, you are free to choose your own storage location as long as you instruct Hypervel to [scan other directories for Artisan commands](#registering-commands).

<a name="generating-commands"></a>
### Generating Commands

To create a new command, you may use the `make:command` Artisan command. This command will create a new command class in the `app/Console/Commands` directory. Don't worry if this directory does not exist in your application - it will be created the first time you run the `make:command` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan make:command SendEmails
```

<a name="command-structure"></a>
### Command Structure

After generating your command, you should define the command's signature and description using the `$signature` and `$description` properties. The `$signature` property also allows you to define [your command's input expectations](#defining-input-expectations). Generated commands use properties because they keep longer command signatures easy to read and edit. The `handle` method will be called when your command is executed. You may place your command logic in this method.

Let's take a look at an example command. Note that we are able to request any dependencies we need via the command's `handle` method. The Hypervel [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container) will automatically inject all dependencies that are type-hinted in this method's signature:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use App\Models\User;
use App\Support\DripEmailer;
use Hypervel\Console\Command;

class SendEmails extends Command
{
    /**
     * The name and signature of the console command.
     */
    protected ?string $signature = 'mail:send {user}';

    /**
     * The console command description.
     */
    protected string $description = 'Send a marketing email to a user';

    /**
     * The console command name aliases.
     */
    protected array $aliases = ['mail:drip'];

    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     */
    public function handle(DripEmailer $drip): void
    {
        $drip->send(User::find($this->argument('user')));
    }
}
```

You may define command aliases using the `$aliases` property. If you would like to hide a command from the command list while keeping it executable, define a `$hidden` property with a value of `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> For greater code reuse, it is good practice to keep your console commands light and let them defer to application services to accomplish their tasks. In the example above, note that we inject a service class to do the "heavy lifting" of sending the emails.

<a name="command-attributes"></a>
#### Command Attributes

Hypervel also supports command attributes if you prefer to define command metadata above the class:

```php
use Hypervel\Console\Attributes\Aliases;
use Hypervel\Console\Attributes\Description;
use Hypervel\Console\Attributes\Help;
use Hypervel\Console\Attributes\Hidden;
use Hypervel\Console\Attributes\Signature;
use Hypervel\Console\Attributes\Usage;
use Hypervel\Console\Command;

#[Signature('mail:send {user}')]
#[Description('Send a marketing email to a user')]
#[Aliases(['mail:drip'])]
#[Help('Send a marketing email to the given user.')]
#[Hidden]
#[Usage('mail:send 1')]
#[Usage('mail:send 1 --queue')]
class SendEmails extends Command
{
    // ...
}
```

You may also pass aliases directly to `Signature`, such as `#[Signature('mail:send {user}', aliases: ['mail:drip'])]`.

The `Help` attribute sets the extended help text shown by `--help`, while the repeatable `Usage` attribute adds usage examples to the command's help screen.

<a name="exit-codes"></a>
#### Exit Codes

If nothing is returned from the `handle` method and the command executes successfully, the command will exit with a `0` exit code, indicating success. However, the `handle` method may optionally return an integer to manually specify the command's exit code:

```php
$this->error('Something went wrong.');

return 1;
```

If you would like to "fail" the command from any method within the command, you may utilize the `fail` method. The `fail` method will immediately terminate execution of the command and return an exit code of `1`:

```php
$this->fail('Something went wrong.');
```

<a name="closure-commands"></a>
### Closure Commands

Closure-based commands provide an alternative to defining console commands as classes. In the same way that route closures are an alternative to controllers, think of command closures as an alternative to command classes.

Even though the `routes/console.php` file does not define HTTP routes, it defines console-based entry points (routes) into your application. Within this file, you may define all of your closure-based console commands using the `Artisan::command` method. The `command` method accepts two arguments: the [command signature](#defining-input-expectations) and a closure which receives the command's arguments and options:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Artisan;

Artisan::command('mail:send {user}', function (string $user) {
    $this->info("Sending email to: {$user}!");
});
```

The closure is bound to the underlying command instance, so you have full access to all of the helper methods you would typically be able to access on a full command class.

<a name="type-hinting-dependencies"></a>
#### Type-Hinting Dependencies

In addition to receiving your command's arguments and options, command closures may also type-hint additional dependencies that you would like resolved out of the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container):

```php
use App\Models\User;
use App\Support\DripEmailer;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Artisan;

Artisan::command('mail:send {user}', function (DripEmailer $drip, string $user) {
    $drip->send(User::find($user));
});
```

<a name="closure-command-descriptions"></a>
#### Closure Command Descriptions

When defining a closure-based command, you may use the `purpose` method to add a description to the command. This description will be displayed when you run the `php artisan list` or `php artisan help` commands:

```php
Artisan::command('mail:send {user}', function (string $user) {
    // ...
})->purpose('Send a marketing email to a user');
```

The `describe` method is also available as an alias for `purpose`.

<a name="coroutine-execution"></a>
### Coroutine Execution

Hypervel runs console commands inside a Swoole coroutine by default, so blocking I/O operations can benefit from Swoole's hooks. Most commands do not need to change this behavior.

If a command must run outside a coroutine, define a `$coroutine` property with a value of `false`:

```php
/**
 * Determine if the command should run in a coroutine.
 */
protected bool $coroutine = false;
```

You may also customize the Swoole hook flags used when the command coroutine is created:

```php
/**
 * The hook flags for the command coroutine.
 */
protected int $hookFlags = SWOOLE_HOOK_ALL & ~SWOOLE_HOOK_CURL;
```

<a name="trait-setup"></a>
### Trait Setup

Traits used by a command may define a setup method named `setUp{TraitName}`. Hypervel calls each setup method before the command's `handle` method on every execution, passing the current input and output instances. This is useful when a reusable command trait needs per-execution initialization:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;

trait UsesReportWindow
{
    protected function setUpUsesReportWindow(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output): void
    {
        // Prepare the trait for this command execution...
    }
}
```

<a name="isolatable-commands"></a>
### Isolatable Commands

> [!WARNING]
> To use this feature across multiple processes or servers, your application should use a shared cache store such as `redis` or `database`. The `file` and `array` stores can coordinate commands only within the same filesystem or process.

Sometimes you may wish to ensure that only one instance of a command can run at a time. To accomplish this, you may implement the `Hypervel\Contracts\Console\Isolatable` interface on your command class:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Hypervel\Console\Command;
use Hypervel\Contracts\Console\Isolatable;

class SendEmails extends Command implements Isolatable
{
    // ...
}
```

When you mark a command as `Isolatable`, Hypervel automatically makes the `--isolated` option available for the command without needing to explicitly define it in the command's options. When the command is invoked with that option, Hypervel will ensure that no other instances of that command are already running. Hypervel accomplishes this by attempting to acquire an atomic lock using your application's default cache driver. If other instances of the command are running, the command will not execute; however, the command will still exit with a successful exit status code:

```shell
php artisan mail:send 1 --isolated
```

If you would like to specify the exit status code that the command should return if it is not able to execute, you may provide the desired status code via the `isolated` option:

```shell
php artisan mail:send 1 --isolated=12
```

<a name="lock-id"></a>
#### Lock ID

By default, Hypervel will use the command's name to generate the string key that is used to acquire the atomic lock in your application's cache. However, you may customize this key by defining an `isolatableId` method on your Artisan command class, allowing you to integrate the command's arguments or options into the key:

```php
/**
 * Get the isolatable ID for the command.
 */
public function isolatableId(): string
{
    return $this->argument('user');
}
```

<a name="lock-expiration-time"></a>
#### Lock Expiration Time

By default, isolation locks expire after the command is finished. Or, if the command is interrupted and unable to finish, the lock will expire after one hour. However, you may adjust the lock expiration time by defining an `isolationLockExpiresAt` method on your command:

```php
use DateTimeInterface;
use DateInterval;

/**
 * Determine when an isolation lock expires for the command.
 */
public function isolationLockExpiresAt(): DateTimeInterface|DateInterval
{
    return now()->plus(minutes: 5);
}
```

<a name="defining-input-expectations"></a>
## Defining Input Expectations

When writing console commands, it is common to gather input from the user through arguments or options. Hypervel makes it very convenient to define the input you expect from the user using the `$signature` property on your commands. The `$signature` property allows you to define the name, arguments, and options for the command in a single, expressive, route-like syntax.

<a name="arguments"></a>
### Arguments

All user supplied arguments and options are wrapped in curly braces. In the following example, the command defines one required argument: `user`:

```php
/**
 * The name and signature of the console command.
 */
protected ?string $signature = 'mail:send {user}';
```

You may also make arguments optional or define default values for arguments:

```php
// Optional argument...
'mail:send {user?}'

// Optional argument with default value...
'mail:send {user=foo}'
```

<a name="options"></a>
### Options

Options, like arguments, are another form of user input. Options are prefixed by two hyphens (`--`) when they are provided via the command line. There are two types of options: those that receive a value and those that don't. Options that don't receive a value serve as a boolean "switch". Let's take a look at an example of this type of option:

```php
/**
 * The name and signature of the console command.
 */
protected ?string $signature = 'mail:send {user} {--queue}';
```

In this example, the `--queue` switch may be specified when calling the Artisan command. If the `--queue` switch is passed, the value of the option will be `true`. Otherwise, the value will be `false`:

```shell
php artisan mail:send 1 --queue
```

<a name="options-with-values"></a>
#### Options With Values

Next, let's take a look at an option that expects a value. If the user must specify a value for an option, you should suffix the option name with a `=` sign:

```php
/**
 * The name and signature of the console command.
 */
protected ?string $signature = 'mail:send {user} {--queue=}';
```

In this example, the user may pass a value for the option like so. If the option is not specified when invoking the command, its value will be `null`:

```shell
php artisan mail:send 1 --queue=default
```

You may assign default values to options by specifying the default value after the option name. If no option value is passed by the user, the default value will be used:

```php
'mail:send {user} {--queue=default}'
```

<a name="option-shortcuts"></a>
#### Option Shortcuts

To assign a shortcut when defining an option, you may specify it before the option name and use the `|` character as a delimiter to separate the shortcut from the full option name:

```php
'mail:send {user} {--Q|queue=}'
```

When invoking the command on your terminal, option shortcuts should be prefixed with a single hyphen and no `=` character should be included when specifying a value for the option:

```shell
php artisan mail:send 1 -Qdefault
```

<a name="input-arrays"></a>
### Input Arrays

If you would like to define arguments or options to expect multiple input values, you may use the `*` character. First, let's take a look at an example that specifies such an argument:

```php
'mail:send {user*}'
```

When running this command, the `user` arguments may be passed in order to the command line. For example, the following command will set the value of `user` to an array with `1` and `2` as its values:

```shell
php artisan mail:send 1 2
```

This `*` character can be combined with an optional argument definition to allow zero or more instances of an argument:

```php
'mail:send {user?*}'
```

<a name="option-arrays"></a>
#### Option Arrays

When defining an option that expects multiple input values, each option value passed to the command should be prefixed with the option name:

```php
'mail:send {--id=*}'
```

Such a command may be invoked by passing multiple `--id` arguments:

```shell
php artisan mail:send --id=1 --id=2
```

<a name="input-descriptions"></a>
### Input Descriptions

You may assign descriptions to input arguments and options by separating the argument name from the description using a colon. If you need a little extra room to define your command, feel free to spread the definition across multiple lines:

```php
/**
 * The name and signature of the console command.
 */
protected ?string $signature = 'mail:send
                        {user : The ID of the user}
                        {--queue : Whether the job should be queued}';
```

<a name="prompting-for-missing-input"></a>
### Prompting for Missing Input

If your command contains required arguments, the user will receive an error message when they are not provided. Alternatively, you may configure your command to automatically prompt the user when required arguments are missing by implementing the `PromptsForMissingInput` interface:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Hypervel\Console\Command;
use Hypervel\Contracts\Console\PromptsForMissingInput;

class SendEmails extends Command implements PromptsForMissingInput
{
    /**
     * The name and signature of the console command.
     */
    protected ?string $signature = 'mail:send {user}';

    // ...
}
```

If Hypervel needs to gather a required argument from the user, it will automatically ask the user for the argument by intelligently phrasing the question using either the argument name or description. If you wish to customize the question used to gather the required argument, you may implement the `promptForMissingArgumentsUsing` method, returning an array of questions keyed by the argument names:

```php
/**
 * Prompt for missing input arguments using the returned questions.
 *
 * @return array<string, string>
 */
protected function promptForMissingArgumentsUsing(): array
{
    return [
        'user' => 'Which user ID should receive the mail?',
    ];
}
```

You may also provide placeholder text by using a tuple containing the question and placeholder:

```php
return [
    'user' => ['Which user ID should receive the mail?', 'E.g. 123'],
];
```

If you would like complete control over the prompt, you may provide a closure that should prompt the user and return their answer:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use function Hypervel\Prompts\search;

// ...

return [
    'user' => fn () => search(
        label: 'Search for a user:',
        placeholder: 'E.g. Taylor Otwell',
        options: fn ($value) => strlen($value) > 0
            ? User::whereLike('name', "%{$value}%")->pluck('name', 'id')->all()
            : []
    ),
];
```

> [!NOTE]
> The comprehensive [Hypervel Prompts](/docs/{{version}}/prompts) documentation includes additional information on the available prompts and their usage.

If you wish to prompt the user to select or enter [options](#options), you may include prompts in your command's `handle` method. However, if you only wish to prompt the user when they have also been automatically prompted for missing arguments, then you may implement the `afterPromptingForMissingArguments` method:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use function Hypervel\Prompts\confirm;

// ...

/**
 * Perform actions after the user was prompted for missing arguments.
 */
protected function afterPromptingForMissingArguments(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output): void
{
    $input->setOption('queue', confirm(
        label: 'Would you like to queue the mail?',
        default: $this->option('queue')
    ));
}
```

<a name="command-io"></a>
## Command I/O

<a name="retrieving-input"></a>
### Retrieving Input

While your command is executing, you will likely need to access the values for the arguments and options accepted by your command. To do so, you may use the `argument` and `option` methods. If an argument or option does not exist, `null` will be returned:

```php
/**
 * Execute the console command.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    $userId = $this->argument('user');
}
```

If you need to retrieve all of the arguments as an `array`, call the `arguments` method:

```php
$arguments = $this->arguments();
```

Options may be retrieved just as easily as arguments using the `option` method. To retrieve all of the options as an array, call the `options` method:

```php
// Retrieve a specific option...
$queueName = $this->option('queue');

// Retrieve all options as an array...
$options = $this->options();
```

You may use the `input` method to retrieve a command's arguments and options as a `Hypervel\Console\CommandInput` instance, which provides the same typed accessors that are available on HTTP requests and other data containers:

```php
/**
 * Execute the console command.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    $from = $this->input()->date('from');

    // ...
}
```

The `input` method may also be used to retrieve a single input value from either the arguments or options:

```php
$queue = $this->input('queue', 'default');
```

If an argument and option have the same name, the argument takes precedence.

<a name="prompting-for-input"></a>
### Prompting for Input

> [!NOTE]
> [Hypervel Prompts](/docs/{{version}}/prompts) is a PHP package for adding beautiful and user-friendly forms to your command-line applications, with browser-like features including placeholder text and validation.

In addition to displaying output, you may also ask the user to provide input during the execution of your command. The `ask` method will prompt the user with the given question, accept their input, and then return the user's input back to your command:

```php
/**
 * Execute the console command.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    $name = $this->ask('What is your name?');

    // ...
}
```

The `ask` method also accepts an optional second argument which specifies the default value that should be returned if no user input is provided:

```php
$name = $this->ask('What is your name?', 'Taylor');
```

The `secret` method is similar to `ask`, but the user's input will not be visible to them as they type in the console. This method is useful when asking for sensitive information such as passwords:

```php
$password = $this->secret('What is the password?');
```

<a name="asking-for-confirmation"></a>
#### Asking for Confirmation

If you need to ask the user for a simple "yes or no" confirmation, you may use the `confirm` method. By default, this method will return `false`. However, if the user enters `y` or `yes` in response to the prompt, the method will return `true`.

```php
if ($this->confirm('Do you wish to continue?')) {
    // ...
}
```

If necessary, you may specify that the confirmation prompt should return `true` by default by passing `true` as the second argument to the `confirm` method:

```php
if ($this->confirm('Do you wish to continue?', true)) {
    // ...
}
```

<a name="auto-completion"></a>
#### Auto-Completion

The `anticipate` method can be used to provide auto-completion for possible choices. The user can still provide any answer, regardless of the auto-completion hints:

```php
$name = $this->anticipate('What is your name?', ['Taylor', 'Dayle']);
```

Alternatively, you may pass a closure as the second argument to the `anticipate` method. The closure will be called each time the user types an input character. The closure should accept a string parameter containing the user's input so far, and return an array of options for auto-completion:

```php
use App\Models\Address;

$name = $this->anticipate('What is your address?', function (string $input) {
    return Address::whereLike('name', "{$input}%")
        ->limit(5)
        ->pluck('name')
        ->all();
});
```

<a name="multiple-choice-questions"></a>
#### Multiple Choice Questions

If you need to give the user a predefined set of choices when asking a question, you may use the `choice` method. You may set the array index of the default value to be returned if no option is chosen by passing the index as the third argument to the method:

```php
$name = $this->choice(
    'What is your name?',
    ['Taylor', 'Dayle'],
    $defaultIndex
);
```

In addition, the `choice` method accepts optional fourth and fifth arguments for determining the maximum number of attempts to select a valid response and whether multiple selections are permitted:

```php
$name = $this->choice(
    'What is your name?',
    ['Taylor', 'Dayle'],
    $defaultIndex,
    $maxAttempts = null,
    $allowMultipleSelections = false
);
```

### Writing Output

To send output to the console, you may use the `line`, `newLine`, `info`, `comment`, `question`, `warn`, `alert`, and `error` methods. Each of these methods will use appropriate ANSI colors for their purpose. For example, let's display some general information to the user. Typically, the `info` method will display in the console as green colored text:

```php
/**
 * Execute the console command.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    // ...

    $this->info('The command was successful!');
}
```

To display an error message, use the `error` method. Error message text is typically displayed in red:

```php
$this->error('Something went wrong!');
```

You may use the `line` method to display plain, uncolored text:

```php
$this->line('Display this on the screen');
```

You may use the `newLine` method to display a blank line:

```php
// Write a single blank line...
$this->newLine();

// Write three blank lines...
$this->newLine(3);
```

<a name="tables"></a>
#### Tables

The `table` method makes it easy to correctly format multiple rows / columns of data. All you need to do is provide the column names and the data for the table and Hypervel will automatically calculate the appropriate width and height of the table for you:

```php
use App\Models\User;

$this->table(
    ['Name', 'Email'],
    User::all(['name', 'email'])->toArray()
);
```

<a name="progress-bars"></a>
#### Progress Bars

For long running tasks, it can be helpful to show a progress bar that informs users how complete the task is. Using the `withProgressBar` method, Hypervel will display a progress bar and advance its progress for each iteration over a given iterable value:

```php
use App\Models\User;

$users = $this->withProgressBar(User::all(), function (User $user) {
    $this->performTask($user);
});
```

Sometimes, you may need more manual control over how a progress bar is advanced. First, define the total number of steps the process will iterate through. Then, advance the progress bar after processing each item:

```php
$users = App\Models\User::all();

$bar = $this->output->createProgressBar(count($users));

$bar->start();

foreach ($users as $user) {
    $this->performTask($user);

    $bar->advance();
}

$bar->finish();
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more advanced options, check out the [Symfony Progress Bar component documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/helpers/progressbar.html).

<a name="registering-commands"></a>
## Registering Commands

By default, Hypervel automatically registers all commands within the `app/Console/Commands` directory. However, you can instruct Hypervel to scan other directories for Artisan commands using the `withCommands` method in your application's `bootstrap/app.php` file:

```php
->withCommands([
    __DIR__.'/../app/Domain/Orders/Commands',
])
```

If necessary, you may also manually register commands by providing the command's class name to the `withCommands` method:

```php
use App\Domain\Orders\Commands\SendEmails;

->withCommands([
    SendEmails::class,
])
```

You may also pass console route files to the `withCommands` method. Console route files may register closure commands using the `Artisan::command` method:

```php
->withCommands([
    __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
])
```

Commands are registered when Artisan boots and resolved by the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container) as needed.

You may inspect a registered command using the `findCommand` method on the `Artisan` facade. This method resolves only the requested command and returns `null` if no command has that name:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Artisan;

$command = Artisan::findCommand('mail:send');

$description = $command?->getDescription();
```

The returned instance is shared by subsequent lookups. To execute the command, use `Artisan::call` so each execution receives its own command instance.

<a name="programmatically-executing-commands"></a>
## Programmatically Executing Commands

Sometimes you may wish to execute an Artisan command outside of the CLI. For example, you may wish to execute an Artisan command from a route or controller. You may use the `call` method on the `Artisan` facade to accomplish this. The `call` method accepts either the command's signature name or class name as its first argument, and an array of command parameters as the second argument. The exit code will be returned:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::post('/user/{user}/mail', function (string $user) {
    $exitCode = Artisan::call('mail:send', [
        'user' => $user, '--queue' => 'default'
    ]);

    // ...
});
```

Alternatively, you may pass the entire Artisan command to the `call` method as a string:

```php
Artisan::call('mail:send 1 --queue=default');
```

<a name="passing-array-values"></a>
#### Passing Array Values

If your command defines an option that accepts an array, you may pass an array of values to that option:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::post('/mail', function () {
    $exitCode = Artisan::call('mail:send', [
        '--id' => [5, 13]
    ]);
});
```

<a name="passing-boolean-values"></a>
#### Passing Boolean Values

If you need to specify the value of an option that does not accept string values, such as the `--force` flag on the `migrate:refresh` command, you should pass `true` or `false` as the value of the option:

```php
$exitCode = Artisan::call('migrate:refresh', [
    '--force' => true,
]);
```

<a name="queueing-artisan-commands"></a>
#### Queueing Artisan Commands

Using the `queue` method on the `Artisan` facade, you may even queue Artisan commands so they are processed in the background by your [queue workers](/docs/{{version}}/queues). Before using this method, make sure you have configured your queue and are running a queue listener:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::post('/user/{user}/mail', function (string $user) {
    Artisan::queue('mail:send', [
        'user' => $user, '--queue' => 'default'
    ]);

    // ...
});
```

Using the `onConnection` and `onQueue` methods, you may specify the connection or queue the Artisan command should be dispatched to:

```php
Artisan::queue('mail:send', [
    'user' => 1, '--queue' => 'default'
])->onConnection('redis')->onQueue('commands');
```

<a name="calling-commands-from-other-commands"></a>
### Calling Commands From Other Commands

Sometimes you may wish to call other commands from an existing Artisan command. You may do so using the `call` method. This `call` method accepts the command name and an array of command arguments / options:

```php
/**
 * Execute the console command.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    $this->call('mail:send', [
        'user' => 1, '--queue' => 'default'
    ]);

    // ...
}
```

If you would like to call another console command and suppress all of its output, you may use the `callSilently` method. The `callSilently` method has the same signature as the `call` method:

```php
$this->callSilently('mail:send', [
    'user' => 1, '--queue' => 'default'
]);
```

<a name="signal-handling"></a>
## Signal Handling

As you may know, operating systems allow signals to be sent to running processes. For example, the `SIGTERM` signal is how operating systems ask a program to terminate gracefully. If you wish to listen for signals in your Artisan console commands and execute code when they occur, you may use the `trap` method:

```php
/**
 * Execute the console command.
 */
public function handle(): void
{
    $this->trap(SIGTERM, fn () => $this->shouldKeepRunning = false);

    while ($this->shouldKeepRunning) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

To listen for multiple signals at once, you may provide an array of signals to the `trap` method:

```php
$this->trap([SIGTERM, SIGQUIT], function (int $signal) {
    $this->shouldKeepRunning = false;

    dump($signal); // SIGTERM / SIGQUIT
});
```

You may also provide an iterable of signal numbers or a closure that returns them. Trapping a termination signal lets your command finish gracefully instead of being terminated automatically. Handlers run in reverse registration order and are removed when their command finishes, leaving other commands' handlers registered.

Command traps share the [native signal limitations](/docs/{{version}}/signals#native-signal-limitations) of worker and server-process handlers. Keep callbacks short: another delivery of the same signal while a callback is running may use the operating system's default behavior. To configure worker or server-process handlers, see the [Signal documentation](/docs/{{version}}/signals).

<a name="the-dev-command"></a>
## The Dev Command

The `dev` Artisan command starts the processes needed for local development in a single terminal window. By default, it runs the [Watcher](/docs/{{version}}/watcher), a queue listener, and Vite asset compilation:

```shell
php artisan dev
```

The command uses the `@laravel/multiplex` npm package to manage the processes, giving each process its own tab with searchable, scrollable output. Each process is labeled and color-coded. If a process crashes, it is restarted automatically, and when you quit, the output is written back to your terminal.

The `dev` command requires Node 22.13 or later. Official Hypervel skeletons include Multiplex as a development dependency. If your application does not have it, install it using your package manager:

```shell
pnpm add -D @laravel/multiplex
```

The default processes are:

| Name | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `server` | `php artisan watch` |
| `queue` | `php artisan queue:listen --tries=1 --timeout=0` |
| `vite` | `dev` script using the detected package manager |

The server process requires `hypervel/watcher`, which is included in official Hypervel skeletons. The `vite` process is registered only when the application has a `package.json` file. It detects your Node package manager (npm, pnpm, Yarn, or Bun) and uses the appropriate run command. Hypervel does not register a Pail log-tailing process.

<a name="customizing-dev-processes"></a>
### Customizing Dev Processes

You may customize the processes that the `dev` command runs using the `DevCommands` class in your application's `AppServiceProvider::boot` method. The `register` method accepts a command string and an optional name:

```php
use Hypervel\Foundation\DevCommands;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    DevCommands::register('some-command --flag', 'my-process');
}
```

When registering an Artisan command, you may use the `artisan` method, which prefixes the command with `php artisan`:

```php
DevCommands::artisan('horizon', 'horizon');
```

Likewise, the `node` method prefixes the command with your detected package manager's run command, such as `npm run`, and `nodeExec` uses its exec command. These examples add a Storybook process and replace the default Vite process:

```php
DevCommands::node('storybook', 'storybook');

DevCommands::nodeExec('vite --host 0.0.0.0', 'vite');
```

With pnpm or Yarn, `nodeExec` takes an installed binary name; npm and Bun accept a package name. Use a name valid for your chosen manager, especially when a scoped package and its binary have different names.

Registering a process with the same name as a default replaces that default. For example, you may replace the default queue listener:

```php
DevCommands::artisan('horizon', 'queue');
```

You may customize a process label's color with `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, `orange`, `green`, or `yellow`. You may also pass a custom hex color to `color`:

```php
DevCommands::register('my-command', 'my-process')->green();

DevCommands::register('my-command', 'my-process')->color('#ff6347');
```

To see all registered processes without starting them, use `dev:list`:

```shell
php artisan dev:list
```

<a name="restarting-failed-processes"></a>
#### Restarting Failed Processes

If a process crashes, Multiplex restarts it after a short delay, up to five times, before marking it as failed. A process that exits within a second of starting is not restarted. Restarting a process manually with `r` resets the counter.

You may disable automatic restarts for a single run with `--no-restart`:

```shell
php artisan dev --no-restart
```

Or, disable them in your service provider:

```php
DevCommands::disableAutoRestart();
```

<a name="dev-output-modes"></a>
### Output Modes and Buffers

Use `--stream` to combine the output in one interactive view, `--tabs` for separate tabs, or `--inline` for plain terminal output. Multiplex uses inline output automatically when the terminal is not interactive. You may set your preferred mode during application boot:

```php
DevCommands::stream();

// Other modes...
DevCommands::tabs();
DevCommands::inline();
```

Command-line mode options override the configured mode. Use `--timestamps` to display a timestamp on each line, or call `DevCommands::withTimestamps()` during boot. The `--json` option emits newline-delimited JSON events and implies inline output.

You may limit buffered output with `--buffer-size` and `--stream-buffer-size`, or configure the limits in your service provider:

```php
DevCommands::bufferSize(1000);
DevCommands::streamBufferSize(2000);
```

The first limit applies to each command's tab; the second applies to the combined stream. Command-line values override these settings.

<a name="filtering-dev-processes"></a>
### Filtering Dev Processes

Use `only` to select processes or `except` to exclude them:

```php
DevCommands::only('server', 'vite');

DevCommands::except('queue');
```

You may exclude commands registered by packages or Hypervel's default commands:

```php
DevCommands::withoutVendorCommands();

DevCommands::withoutDefaultCommands();
```

To place selected processes first, configure their order during boot. Processes not listed retain their registration order after them:

```php
DevCommands::order(['vite', 'server', 'queue']);
```

<a name="stub-customization"></a>
## Stub Customization

The Artisan console's `make` commands are used to create a variety of classes, such as controllers, jobs, migrations, and tests. These classes are generated using "stub" files that are populated with values based on your input. However, you may want to make small changes to files generated by Artisan. To accomplish this, you may use the `stub:publish` command to publish the most common stubs to your application so that you can customize them:

```shell
php artisan stub:publish
```

The published stubs will be located within a `stubs` directory in the root of your application. Any changes you make to these stubs will be reflected when you generate their corresponding classes using Artisan's `make` commands.

<a name="events"></a>
## Events

Artisan dispatches three framework-level events outside the command's execution boundary: `Hypervel\Console\Events\ArtisanStarting`, `Hypervel\Console\Events\CommandStarting`, and `Hypervel\Console\Events\CommandFinished`. The `ArtisanStarting` event is dispatched immediately when Artisan starts running. Next, the `CommandStarting` event is dispatched immediately before a command runs. Finally, the `CommandFinished` event is dispatched once a command finishes executing.

Hypervel also dispatches command lifecycle events inside that execution boundary: `Hypervel\Console\Events\BeforeHandle`, `Hypervel\Console\Events\AfterHandle`, and `Hypervel\Console\Events\AfterExecute`. The `BeforeHandle` event is dispatched immediately before the command's `handle` method is called and includes the original console input. The `AfterHandle` event is dispatched after the `handle` method completes successfully. The `AfterExecute` event is dispatched after execution completes, whether the command succeeded or failed, and includes the original input, normalized exit code, and any thrown exception. Commands normally run in a coroutine, but a command may disable coroutine execution, so listeners should check before using coroutine-only APIs.
