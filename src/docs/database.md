## Introduction

Almost every modern web application interacts with a database. Hypervel makes interacting with databases extremely simple across a variety of supported databases using raw SQL, a [fluent query builder](/docs/{{version}}/queries), and the [Eloquent ORM](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent). Currently, Hypervel provides first-party support for four databases:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- MariaDB 10.3+ ([Version Policy](https://mariadb.org/about/#maintenance-policy))
- MySQL 5.7+ ([Version Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL#Release_history))
- PostgreSQL 10.0+ ([Version Policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/))
- SQLite 3.26.0+

</div>

<a name="configuration"></a>
### Configuration

The configuration for Hypervel's database services is located in your application's `config/database.php` configuration file. In this file, you may define all of your database connections, as well as specify which connection should be used by default. Most of the configuration options within this file are driven by the values of your application's environment variables. Examples for most of Hypervel's supported database systems are provided in this file.

By default, Hypervel's sample [environment configuration](/docs/{{version}}/configuration#environment-configuration) uses SQLite. However, you are free to modify your database configuration as needed for your local database.

<a name="mysql-and-mariadb-sql-modes"></a>
#### MySQL and MariaDB SQL Modes

MySQL and MariaDB connections must configure either `strict` or `modes`. The shipped configuration uses `'strict' => true`. To choose the session's SQL modes explicitly, set `modes` on the connection; this takes precedence over `strict`:

```php
'modes' => ['STRICT_TRANS_TABLES', 'NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION', 'NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES'],
```

If your application uses `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`, include it here instead of relying on the server's default mode. Hypervel uses this configuration to quote values correctly. Keep the backslash-escaping mode consistent across read and write connections.

<a name="sqlite-configuration"></a>
#### SQLite Configuration

SQLite databases are contained within a single file on your filesystem. You can create a new SQLite database using the `touch` command in your terminal: `touch database/database.sqlite`. After the database has been created, you may easily configure your environment variables to point to this database by placing the absolute path to the database in the `DB_DATABASE` environment variable:

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/database.sqlite
```

By default, foreign key constraints are enabled for SQLite connections. If you would like to disable them, you should set the `DB_FOREIGN_KEYS` environment variable to `false`:

```ini
DB_FOREIGN_KEYS=false
```

<a name="masking-bindings-in-exception-messages"></a>
#### Masking Bindings in Exception Messages

By default, database exceptions include bound values in the SQL shown in their messages. To leave placeholders in that SQL instead, set the `DB_MASK_BINDINGS` environment variable:

```ini
DB_MASK_BINDINGS=true
```

For custom connections, set `mask_bindings_in_exception_messages` to `true` in the connection's configuration. Omitting this option or setting it to `null` disables masking.

This option does not change the database's original error message, query logs, or query events. The exception's binding accessors remain available, and `getRawSql()` still returns SQL with the bindings included.

<a name="lock-timeouts"></a>
#### Lock Timeouts

A lock timeout limits how long a database statement may wait to acquire a lock. It does not limit the total duration of a transaction. Hypervel does not change your database's lock timeout unless you configure one.

For MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL connections, you may specify a positive timeout in seconds using the `lock_timeout` option:

```php
'lock_timeout' => (int) env('DB_LOCK_TIMEOUT', 5),
```

On MariaDB and MySQL, Hypervel applies this value to both InnoDB row locks and metadata locks. As a result, DDL statements issued through the connection will also stop waiting after this interval.

SQLite uses its existing `busy_timeout` option, expressed in milliseconds:

```php
'busy_timeout' => (int) env('DB_BUSY_TIMEOUT', 5_000),
```

The `busy_timeout` option applies only to SQLite connections and is ignored by other database drivers.

The timeout is applied whenever Hypervel creates or reconnects a physical database connection. An expired timeout is treated as a concurrency error, so a [transaction configured with multiple attempts](#handling-concurrency-errors) may retry it. If different parts of your application need different timeout policies, define separate database connections for them.

<a name="postgresql-keepalives"></a>
#### PostgreSQL Keepalives

PostgreSQL's client library enables TCP keepalives by default. You may adjust them using these options in your PostgreSQL connection configuration:

```php
'keepalives' => 1,
'keepalives_idle' => 600,
'keepalives_interval' => 30,
'keepalives_count' => 5,
```

The idle and interval values are in seconds; the count limits unanswered probes. Set `keepalives` to `0` to disable keepalives. Omitting these options or setting them to `null` leaves the PostgreSQL client's defaults unchanged; `0` uses the system default for idle, interval, and count.

These options apply to TCP connections, not Unix-domain sockets. See PostgreSQL's [connection parameter documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS) for platform support.

<a name="postgresql-server-options"></a>
#### PostgreSQL Server Options

Use `server_options` to send PostgreSQL settings when a connection opens. This is useful for settings that a proxy or pooler must receive before the first query:

```php
'server_options' => [
    'statement_timeout' => '5s',
    'synchronous_commit' => 'off',
],
```

These options may also be placed inside a connection's `read` or `write` configuration. Dedicated configuration keys, such as `search_path`, `timezone`, `isolation_level`, `lock_timeout`, `synchronous_commit`, `application_name`, and `charset`, take precedence over their corresponding server options. Use strings such as `'on'` and `'off'` for boolean PostgreSQL settings.

<a name="configuration-using-urls"></a>
#### Configuration Using URLs

Typically, database connections are configured using multiple configuration values such as `host`, `database`, `username`, `password`, etc. Each of these configuration values has its own corresponding environment variable. This means that when configuring your database connection information on a production server, you need to manage several environment variables.

Some managed database providers such as AWS and Heroku provide a single database "URL" that contains all of the connection information for the database in a single string. An example database URL may look something like the following:

```html
mysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/forge?charset=UTF-8
```

These URLs typically follow a standard schema convention:

```html
driver://username:password@host:port/database?options
```

For convenience, Hypervel supports these URLs as an alternative to configuring your database with multiple configuration options. If the `url` (or corresponding `DB_URL` environment variable) configuration option is present, it will be used to extract the database connection and credential information.

<a name="read-and-write-connections"></a>
### Read and Write Connections

Sometimes you may wish to use one database connection for SELECT statements, and another for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Hypervel makes this a breeze, and the proper connections will always be used whether you are using raw queries, the query builder, or the Eloquent ORM.

To see how read / write connections should be configured, let's look at this example:

```php
'mysql' => [
    'driver' => 'mysql',

    'read' => [
        'host' => [
            '192.168.1.1',
            '196.168.1.2',
        ],
    ],
    'write' => [
        'host' => [
            '192.168.1.3',
        ],
    ],
    'sticky' => true,

    'port' => (int) env('DB_PORT', 3306),
    'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'hypervel'),
    'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'root'),
    'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
    'unix_socket' => env('DB_SOCKET', ''),
    'charset' => env('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4'),
    'collation' => env('DB_COLLATION', 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'),
    'prefix' => env('DB_PREFIX', ''),
    'prefix_indexes' => true,
    'strict' => true,
    'engine' => null,
    'options' => extension_loaded('pdo_mysql') ? array_filter([
        \Pdo\Mysql::ATTR_SSL_CA => env('MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA'),
    ]) : [],
    'pool' => [
        'min_retained_connections' => (int) env('DB_MIN_RETAINED_CONNECTIONS', 1),
        'max_connections' => (int) env('DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS', 10),
        'connect_timeout' => 10.0,
        'wait_timeout' => 3.0,
        'heartbeat_interval' => ($duration = env('DB_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL')) === null ? null : (float) $duration,
        'heartbeat_timeout' => (float) env('DB_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT', 1.0),
        'idle_check_interval' => null,
        'max_idle_time' => ($duration = env('DB_MAX_IDLE_TIME', 60)) === null ? null : (float) $duration,
        'max_lifetime' => ($duration = env('DB_MAX_LIFETIME')) === null ? null : (float) $duration,
    ],
],
```

Note that three keys have been added to the configuration array: `read`, `write` and `sticky`. The `read` and `write` keys have array values containing a single key: `host`. The rest of the database options for the `read` and `write` connections will be merged from the main `mysql` configuration array.

You only need to place items in the `read` and `write` arrays if you wish to override the values from the main `mysql` array. So, in this case, `192.168.1.1` will be used as the host for the "read" connection, while `192.168.1.3` will be used for the "write" connection. The database credentials, prefix, character set, pool configuration, and all other options in the main `mysql` array will be shared across both connections. When multiple values exist in the `host` configuration array, a database host will be randomly chosen when a new connection is established.

The `read` and `write` arrays may also define their own `url`. The URL is parsed after the main connection options are merged and overrides the matching values for that connection.

You may also resolve a specific side of a configured read / write connection by appending `::read` or `::write` to the connection name:

```php
$users = DB::connection('mysql::read')->select('select * from users');
$count = DB::connection('mysql::write')->table('users')->count();
```

Use these suffixes when you need to explicitly inspect a replica or force reads through the write connection. Normal application queries do not need them; Hypervel routes reads, writes, transactions, and sticky reads automatically.

Eloquent models created or retrieved through `::write` retain that connection for later saves and relation queries, including its current transaction. Models retrieved through `::read` use the base connection name for subsequent operations, so saves reach the primary.

<a name="the-sticky-option"></a>
#### The `sticky` Option

The `sticky` option is an *optional* value that can be used to allow the immediate reading of records that have been written to the database during the current request cycle. If the `sticky` option is enabled and a "write" operation has been performed against the database during the current request cycle, any further "read" operations will use the "write" connection. This ensures that any data written during the request cycle can be immediately read back from the database during that same request. In Hypervel, sticky state belongs to the coroutine's connection and survives an early release of its physical session. Other coroutines have independent routing state. It is up to you to decide if this is the desired behavior for your application.

<a name="connection-pooling"></a>
### Connection Pooling

Hypervel uses connection pools to keep database access efficient within long-lived Swoole workers. When a coroutine resolves a database connection, Hypervel borrows a physical session from the worker's pool. The coroutine keeps its own connection object, including query logs, callbacks and read / write routing state. Query and schema builders retain that object even if its idle session is returned to the pool and another session is borrowed later. When the coroutine or task ends, Hypervel rolls back unfinished transactions, including those started directly through PDO or SQL, and returns its remaining borrowed sessions.

A connection and the query builders created from it belong to the coroutine or task that resolved them. Build queries inside each child coroutine instead of passing builders or connections between coroutines, and do not keep them after the coroutine or task finishes. Connections that support early release remain usable across releases within that execution, but throw an exception if asked to borrow another session after it finishes.

Each connection may define its own `pool` configuration:

```php
'mysql' => [
    // ...

    'pool' => [
        'min_retained_connections' => (int) env('DB_MIN_RETAINED_CONNECTIONS', 1),
        'max_connections' => (int) env('DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS', 10),
        'connect_timeout' => 10.0,
        'wait_timeout' => 3.0,
        'heartbeat_interval' => ($duration = env('DB_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL')) === null ? null : (float) $duration,
        'heartbeat_timeout' => (float) env('DB_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT', 1.0),
        'idle_check_interval' => null,
        'max_idle_time' => ($duration = env('DB_MAX_IDLE_TIME', 60)) === null ? null : (float) $duration,
        'max_lifetime' => ($duration = env('DB_MAX_LIFETIME')) === null ? null : (float) $duration,
    ],
],
```

The `min_retained_connections` option controls how many connections Hypervel keeps when trimming excess idle connections. Connections are opened only when needed, so the first operation that uses a new connection waits for it to open. This setting does not create connections in advance or replace connections that fail, expire, or are discarded. The pool may have no idle connections while they are all in use.

The `max_connections` option determines the maximum number of connections that may be opened for the worker. The `connect_timeout` option controls how long Hypervel will wait while opening a new database connection, while `wait_timeout` controls how long a coroutine may wait for an available connection when the pool is exhausted.

You may enable background health checks by setting `heartbeat_interval` to a positive number of seconds. By default, it is null and heartbeats are disabled. These checks do not fire query events, write to query logs, or invoke query duration handlers. PDO drivers use a raw `SELECT 1` query, while other drivers use their own health checks. The `heartbeat_timeout` option limits how long a check may run before the connection is discarded.

The `max_idle_time` option controls how long a connection may remain unused before it expires. Background heartbeats remove idle connections above `min_retained_connections`; a connection that has expired is also refreshed before its next use. Set `max_idle_time` to null to disable idle expiry.

You may use `max_lifetime` to replace connections periodically, even when they are used regularly. Hypervel replaces an expired connection only while it is idle or before it is reused. To avoid reconnecting every connection at once, each connection receives a lifetime between 90 and 100 percent of the configured value. By default, `max_lifetime` is null and lifetime expiry is disabled.

For the full option reference and custom maintenance behavior, see the [pool documentation](/docs/{{version}}/pools#connection-pool-options).

For a connection with separate read and write hosts, each base pool slot may lazily open one write PDO and one read PDO. It does not open one PDO per configured host. If `max_connections` is `10`, a worker may therefore hold up to roughly 20 server-side database connections for that configured connection once both sides have been used. Size your database server, PgBouncer, PgDog, or other pooler capacity with that in mind. Increase `max_connections` for more concurrent database work per worker, not simply because you configured more read hosts.

When a read side is configured, explicit `::read` connections use a separate read-side pool built from the merged read configuration, including the base `pool` settings unless the read configuration overrides them. Extensions registered through `DB::extend` for the connection name or its top-level driver receive the complete connection configuration so they can select their own endpoints. An extension selected by a read record receives that record's merged configuration. The pool's options come from the merged read configuration. Without a read side, `::read` uses the base pool. Explicit `::write` connections do not create a separate pool, but a coroutine that uses both `mysql` and `mysql::write` at the same time may borrow two slots from the base pool. Most applications do not need these suffixes in normal query paths because Hypervel already routes reads, writes, transactions, and sticky reads automatically.

If your `read` configuration contains a list of connection records, Hypervel chooses a record for each new physical connection and chooses again when reconnecting. All records in an explicit `::read` pool must have the same effective `pool` options, including inherited defaults. Conflicting options throw an exception when the pool is created, since the records share one pool capacity and lifecycle policy. Derived read pools cannot use in-memory SQLite databases.

Heartbeat and max lifetime recycling apply to Hypervel's worker pool whether the connection points directly at the database or through a proxy / pooler. They help long-running workers avoid stale sockets and rotate old idle connection generations before those connections are used by a request.

Hypervel's default database configuration also includes a `pgsql-pooled` connection. This connection is intended for PostgreSQL transaction poolers such as PgBouncer and uses separate `DB_POOLED_*` environment variables. It also sets `migrations_connection` to `pgsql`, allowing your application to use the pooled connection at runtime while migration commands use the direct PostgreSQL connection.

You may use `migrations_connection` on any database connection to instruct migration commands to run against another configured connection. This is useful when a runtime connection points at a database pooler that does not support every operation required by migrations.

When you need a direct connection for migrations or schema operations, configure it as a normal connection and reference it with `migrations_connection`. Hypervel does not use Laravel's `::direct` connection suffix.

<a name="releasing-and-pinning-connections"></a>
#### Releasing and Pinning Connections

A request may spend much longer waiting for an external service than running database queries. Holding a database session throughout that wait prevents other requests from using it, even though the database has no work to do.

Hypervel's [HTTP client](/docs/{{version}}/http-client) automatically returns the current execution's idle database sessions to their pools before sending an outgoing request, including retries and redirects. This happens after request callbacks, so connections used by those callbacks can also be released. The next database operation borrows a session automatically. Existing connection objects, builders, query logs and sticky reads remain valid. No database connection is opened merely to release it.

Registered [session configurators](#configuring-database-session-state) apply the current execution's settings before a borrowed PDO is used, updating the physical session only when its desired state changes. Ordinary database queries need no changes to take advantage of early release.

Before other external work, you may release idle sessions explicitly using `DB::releaseIdleConnections()`. This is also useful before starting concurrent work: each child coroutine owns its own connections and cannot release a session held by its parent.

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Http;

use function Hypervel\Coroutine\parallel;

$order = DB::table('orders')->find($orderId);

DB::releaseIdleConnections();

$responses = parallel([
    fn () => Http::get($inventoryUrl),
    fn () => Http::get($shippingUrl),
]);
```

Automatic release occurs before sending a request, not on every read of a streamed response. If your stream consumer performs database work between chunks, you may call `releaseIdleConnections()` before waiting for more data. Faked HTTP requests do not release connections. If you provide your own Guzzle client using `setClient`, call `DB::releaseIdleConnections()` yourself before sending requests.

Active queries, transactions, open cursors and `Schema::withoutForeignKeyConstraints` callbacks retain their sessions automatically. This includes transactions started directly through PDO or SQL, on either the read or write connection. In particular, an HTTP call inside `DB::transaction()` keeps the transaction's connection. Completed `chunk` or `lazy` query batches may release between batches.

If your code requires the same physical session across an external call, wrap the entire operation in `DB::withPinnedSession()`. For a named connection, call `withPinnedSession()` on that connection. For example, a PostgreSQL session-level advisory lock must be released on the session that acquired it:

```php
$connection = DB::connection('pgsql');

$response = $connection->withPinnedSession(function () use ($connection, $accountId, $paymentUrl, $payload) {
    $connection->selectFromWriteConnection('select pg_advisory_lock(?)', [$accountId]);

    try {
        return Http::post($paymentUrl, $payload);
    } finally {
        $connection->selectFromWriteConnection('select pg_advisory_unlock(?)', [$accountId]);
    }
});
```

Pinning is also needed for temporary tables, retained raw PDOs or statements, and manual session changes spanning a release boundary. It applies to a manual `disableForeignKeyConstraints` / `enableForeignKeyConstraints` pair; prefer the scoped `withoutForeignKeyConstraints` method. Each pin protects its connection until the callback returns or throws, and pins may be nested. Complete any lazy work inside the callback rather than returning it for later execution. Pinning prevents early release but does not prevent replacing a broken connection during the normal lost-connection retry.

Connections registered through `DB::extend` retain their complete driver object until execution ends; early release leaves them alone. This includes extensions selected by read records in an explicit `::read` pool. The same applies when selectable write records (or read records in an explicit `::read` pool) specify different drivers, database names or table prefixes. PDO drivers registered through `Connection::resolverFor` participate in early release when those values agree.

<a name="configuring-database-session-state"></a>
### Configuring Database Session State

PDO database connections may stay open and be reused across requests and jobs. If your application uses a PDO session setting that can change between requests or jobs, you may use a session configurator to keep it up to date. Native and HTTP database drivers should configure their own client sessions through their connection implementation.

Session configurators implement the `SessionConfigurator` contract. The following example keeps PostgreSQL's `application_name` setting up to date:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Database;

use Hypervel\Database\PdoConnection;
use Hypervel\Database\SessionConfigurator;
use PDO;

final class ApplicationNameConfigurator implements SessionConfigurator
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $applicationName,
    ) {
    }

    public function state(PdoConnection $connection): ?string
    {
        return $connection->getDriverName() === 'pgsql'
            ? $this->applicationName
            : null;
    }

    public function apply(PDO $pdo, string $state, PdoConnection $connection): void
    {
        $statement = $pdo->prepare(
            "select set_config('application_name', ?, false)"
        );
        $statement->execute([$state]);
        $statement->closeCursor();
    }
}
```

You should register the configurator in the `boot` method of a service provider:

```php
use App\Database\ApplicationNameConfigurator;
use Hypervel\Database\PdoConnection;

PdoConnection::configureSessionUsing(
    $this->app->make(ApplicationNameConfigurator::class)
);
```

Registered configurators remain active for the lifetime of the worker and may be shared by several coroutines, so you should register them only during application boot. If a setting depends on the current request or job, read that context inside the `state` method. Do not store request or job data on the configurator itself. If you register more than one configurator, Hypervel runs them in registration order.

The `state` method returns a string that represents the settings the configurator wants to apply. The string should change whenever any setting managed by the configurator changes. Hypervel uses this string to determine whether the database connection needs to be updated. This method is called whenever Hypervel retrieves a PDO, so it should be fast and must not query the database or another service. If building the string takes work, compute it once when the request or job context is set instead of rebuilding it on every call.

An empty string is a valid state. Return `null` only when the configurator will never manage that database connection. Do not return `null` to represent missing request or job context when that context is required for security. Instead, return a real state that prevents the connection from receiving unintended access.

The `apply` method receives the PDO that needs to be configured. Use this PDO directly and bind any dynamic values as parameters. Do not call `getPdo`, `getReadPdo`, or run queries through the database connection from `apply`. Hypervel detects this and throws an exception.

The `apply` method must apply all the settings represented by the state string to the database session. When using PostgreSQL, use session-level `SET` or `set_config(..., false)`. Do not use `SET LOCAL` or `set_config(..., true)`, since those settings last only for the current transaction.

Hypervel tracks the applied state separately for the read and write PDOs. It applies the settings when a PDO is first used, when the state changes, after a reconnect, and after a rollback that may have undone a setting. Returning a connection to the pool or committing a transaction does not cause unchanged settings to be applied again. If configuration fails, Hypervel will not run the application query, and a pooled connection will not be returned as healthy.

When the state has not changed, Hypervel runs no configuration SQL. The `state` method is still called, so it should remain quick. If you do not register a configurator, Hypervel stores no session state and runs no configuration SQL.

The `getPdo` and `getReadPdo` methods configure the PDO before returning it. The `getRawPdo` and `getRawReadPdo` methods do not. Hypervel also cannot detect changes made through a PDO that your application kept from an earlier call. Do not manually change a setting that is owned by a configurator through one of these paths.

> [!NOTE]
> SQL executed by `apply` uses PDO directly and does not appear in Hypervel's query log or trigger query events. When a query triggers configuration, the setup time is included in that query's duration.

> [!WARNING]
> If a setting must persist across queries and your application connects through a database proxy or connection pooler, use a mode that keeps the same database session. For example, PgBouncer must use session pooling. Transaction and statement pooling may send consecutive queries to different database sessions, so the setting may be missing from the next query. Hypervel cannot detect the pooler's mode for you. Direct database connections are not affected.

<a name="extending-database-connections"></a>
### Extending Database Connections

Hypervel provides separate extension points for PDO drivers and drivers that use another transport.

If your driver uses PDO, register a connection resolver during application boot. The resolver receives the lazy PDO connection, database name, table prefix, and normalized configuration. It should return a `PdoConnection` instance:

```php
use App\Database\TenantAwareMySqlConnection;
use Closure;
use Hypervel\Database\Connection;
use Hypervel\Database\PdoConnection;
use PDO;

Connection::resolverFor('mysql', function (
    PDO|Closure $pdo,
    string $database,
    string $prefix,
    array $config,
): PdoConnection {
    return new TenantAwareMySqlConnection(
        $pdo, $database, $prefix, $config
    );
});
```

For a custom PDO driver name, also bind `db.connector.{driver}` in your service provider. The connector must implement `Hypervel\Database\Connectors\ConnectorInterface`; its `connect` method receives the configuration and returns a PDO instance. Existing driver names use Hypervel's built-in connectors unless you replace their binding.

If your driver uses an HTTP client, native extension, or another non-PDO transport, extend the driver-neutral `Connection` class and register it during application boot using the `DB::extend` method:

```php
use App\Database\ClickHouseConnection;
use Hypervel\Database\Connection;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

DB::extend('clickhouse', function (array $config, ?string $name): Connection {
    return new ClickHouseConnection(
        database: $config['database'] ?? '',
        tablePrefix: $config['prefix'],
        config: $config,
    );
});
```

The extension name may be a driver name or a configured connection name. A connection-specific extension takes precedence over a driver extension. The resolver receives the complete connection configuration with its base URL parsed and any `read` and `write` records retained. The driver owns endpoint selection and parsing of role-specific URLs. Pooled connections also include the normalized `connect_timeout` value, allowing the driver to apply the pool's connection deadline to its client.

Custom connections implement their own query execution, transactions, escaping, health check, reconnection, and cleanup behavior. They must also return their driver key, such as `clickhouse`, from the protected `getDefaultDriverName` method. Hypervel uses this value when the connection has no configured driver name; an explicitly configured driver name still takes precedence.

Hypervel's database pool calls these connection methods without assuming PDO, so a native or HTTP driver does not need to create a fake PDO instance.

Drivers with separate read and write resources may call the protected `resolveReadWriteType` method before selecting a resource. It returns `read` or `write`, honoring active transactions, forced write routing, and sticky reads. Pass `false` for a write operation. The method also records the selected role for query events and exceptions. Resource lookup remains the driver's responsibility; if a read falls back to the write resource, record that fallback in `latestReadWriteTypeRetrieved`.

An explicit `::read` connection with a configured read side carries `read_write_type = 'read'`. The driver must use that side for every operation, including statements and forced-write reads, just as Hypervel's PDO drivers do. Without a read side, use the connection's ordinary fallback behavior; direct resolution may still supply the read marker. Do not require a write marker for `::write`: pooled resolution forces write routing through `useWriteConnectionWhenReading`, which the role resolver already honors.

Use the protected `run` method when your execution callback returns a completed response. If execution continues while rows are consumed, use `runStreaming` instead. It accepts the same query, bindings, and callback arguments, with the callback returning an iterable. Hooks and execution begin when iteration starts, and success is logged only after normal exhaustion. The recorded duration includes consumer work between yields, which also counts toward cumulative query-duration thresholds. Iteration failures follow the normal query-exception and `QueryFailed` paths; cancellation passes through unchanged. The callback remains responsible for closing its resources in a `finally` block when iteration ends or is abandoned.

If an active stream is explicitly closed, its next advancement must throw `Hypervel\Database\StreamClosedException` instead of ending as though the query completed. `runStreaming` passes this exception through unchanged, without incrementing the connection's error count, logging a successful query, or dispatching query events. Resource cleanup still belongs in the driver's `finally` block.

`runStreaming` calls the existing lost-connection retry hook only before the first value has been yielded. Drivers must also reject retries when their operation cannot be replayed safely, including when a progress callback has already exposed part of the response. The streaming boundary restores the outer operation's role when a consumer resumes it after running another query. Existing PDO cursors retain their execute-time event boundary.

Both execution methods construct database errors through the protected `newQueryException` method. Drivers whose parameter types need custom error formatting may override this method to return a `QueryException` subclass. Preserve the original query, bindings, and cause; exceptions that are not database failures may be rethrown unchanged. The base implementation continues to prepare bindings and enrich unique-constraint errors with the reported index or columns. It returns an `InvalidValueException` when the protected `isDataTypeError` method identifies an invalid or out-of-range value; override that method to classify your driver's errors.

Query builders with statement-level options may override the protected `Query\Builder::ensureCanEmbedQuery` method to reject options that belong on the outer statement. It runs when attaching a subquery, scalar or exists predicate, or union member; call the parent to preserve the built-in rejection of embedded timeouts.

Custom Eloquent builders may override the public `ensureCanCreateOrFirst(): void` method to reject helpers that depend on unique-constraint recovery. Both `firstOrCreate` and `createOrFirst` call it before reading or writing, including their relationship forms; `updateOrCreate` and `incrementOrCreate` reach it through those helpers. Helpers delegate to each other, so validation may run more than once per operation; keep overrides side-effect-free. Relationships use the related model's builder, even when the parent uses another driver. The default method imposes no restriction, and ordinary `create`, `save`, and `firstOrNew` are unchanged.

The migration repository delegates its table definition to `Schema\Builder::createMigrationRepositoryTable`. A driver may override this method when it needs a different physical schema, while retaining the standard repository and migration commands. Its table must support storing migration names and integer batch numbers; the default definition also includes an auto-incrementing `id`. Repository reads may return batch numbers as integers or numeric strings, depending on the driver, and do not require an `id` column.

Schema builders may override the protected `selectMetadata(string $query): array` method to customize metadata execution without copying the public inspection methods. The default reads from the write connection, so schema checks observe the same database that migrations modify. It covers schema, table, view, type, column, index, and foreign-key list reads, including built-in builder overrides, SQLite's stored table definitions, and the checks derived from them. Session-state reads and capability probes retain their own execution paths. Return the raw rows expected by the driver's processor. For schema writes, the protected `executeStatements(array $statements): void` method executes compiled statements in order and throws if a statement returns false.

The native `DatabaseTruncation` testing trait delegates to `Schema\Builder::truncateTables` after applying its table filters. It passes the complete list of selected schema-qualified names with the connection's table prefix temporarily disabled. The default implementation checks for rows on the write connection and truncates non-empty tables through the query builder, so replica lag cannot skip cleanup. Drivers with engine-specific reset behavior may override this bulk method while keeping `getTables` accurate and using the native testing traits. If a selected table cannot be safely reset, throw an exception instead of silently leaving test data behind.

To add column modifiers, a `Schema\Blueprint` subclass may override the protected `newColumnDefinition(array $attributes)` method and return its own `ColumnDefinition` subclass. Declare `@extends Blueprint<YourColumnDefinition>` on the Blueprint subclass so static analysis recognizes the custom return type from inherited helpers such as `string`, `unsignedBigInteger`, and `timestamps`. Foreign-ID helpers retain their specialized definition and constraint methods. Column-list accessors continue to return base definitions because a Blueprint may contain several definition types.

Custom query builders may declare their binding-slot names through the third `Query\Builder` template argument, after the result key and row types. Initialize the additional keys in the builder's `bindings` array; the existing binding methods validate those keys at runtime. The `newQuery`, `forNestedWhere`, and protected `cloneForPaginationCount` methods return `static`, retaining the concrete builder and its binding types. Overrides must preserve that return contract. The protected `forSubQuery` method returns a base query builder because a join's subquery belongs to its parent query, not the join itself.

<a name="static-analysis"></a>
### Static Analysis

The Hypervel database package includes a PHPStan extension that understands named scopes, soft deleting query methods such as `withTrashed` and `restore`, and query methods forwarded through Eloquent models, builders, and relationships. See the [static analysis setup instructions](/docs/{{version}}/installation#static-analysis) to enable it in your application.

A scope that declares no return type, or declares `void`, `null`, or the query builder, stays chainable. Declaring a broader type such as `mixed` or `object` tells the analyzer the scope may return something else, so that type is preserved. When a scope declares a union containing the query builder, such as `Builder|int`, the builder becomes the chainable receiver and the remaining types are kept.

Configure a [custom Eloquent builder](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent#custom-eloquent-builders) on the model, for example with `#[UseEloquentBuilder(YourBuilder::class)]`, then add the `HasBuilder` trait with `@use HasBuilder<YourBuilder<static>>` for static typing. The extension follows the model's declared `query()` return type, including through relationships. If your Eloquent builder also uses a custom query builder, declare that type on `getQuery()`. Forwarded methods retain the Eloquent builder or relationship when they are chainable, while custom Eloquent terminal methods retain their result types. Query builders declaring `TKey` and `TValue` templates preserve model-valued callback signatures during forwarding; direct `getQuery()` and `toBase()` calls keep their raw-row types.

## Running SQL Queries

Once you have configured your database connection, you may run queries using the `DB` facade. The `DB` facade provides methods for each type of query: `select`, `update`, `insert`, `delete`, and `statement`.

<a name="running-a-select-query"></a>
#### Running a Select Query

To run a basic SELECT query, you may use the `select` method on the `DB` facade:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;
use Hypervel\View\View;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Show a list of all of the application's users.
     */
    public function index(): View
    {
        $users = DB::select('select * from users where active = ?', [1]);

        return view('user.index', ['users' => $users]);
    }
}
```

The first argument passed to the `select` method is the SQL query, while the second argument is any parameter bindings that need to be bound to the query. Typically, these are the values of the `where` clause constraints. Parameter binding provides protection against SQL injection.

The `select` method will always return an `array` of results. Each result within the array will be a PHP `stdClass` object representing a record from the database:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

$users = DB::select('select * from users');

foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name;
}
```

<a name="selecting-scalar-values"></a>
#### Selecting Scalar Values

Sometimes your database query may result in a single, scalar value. Instead of being required to retrieve the query's scalar result from a record object, Hypervel allows you to retrieve this value directly using the `scalar` method:

```php
$burgers = DB::scalar(
    "select count(case when food = 'burger' then 1 end) as burgers from menu"
);
```

<a name="selecting-multiple-result-sets"></a>
#### Selecting Multiple Result Sets

If your application calls stored procedures that return multiple result sets, you may use the `selectResultSets` method to retrieve all of the result sets returned by the stored procedure:

```php
[$options, $notifications] = DB::selectResultSets(
    "CALL get_user_options_and_notifications(?)", [$request->user()->id]
);
```

<a name="using-named-bindings"></a>
#### Using Named Bindings

Instead of using `?` to represent your parameter bindings, you may execute a query using named bindings:

```php
$results = DB::select('select * from users where id = :id', ['id' => 1]);
```

<a name="binding-binary-values"></a>
#### Binding Binary Values

When passing an already-encoded binary string directly to the query builder, wrap it in a `BinaryParameter`. This tells the database driver to bind the value as binary instead of text:

```php
use Hypervel\Database\BinaryParameter;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

$uuid = new BinaryParameter($uuidBytes);

$user = DB::table('users')->where('uuid', $uuid)->first();

DB::table('users')
    ->where('id', $userId)
    ->update(['uuid' => $uuid]);

DB::table('users')->upsert(
    [['uuid' => $uuid, 'name' => 'Taylor']],
    uniqueBy: ['uuid'],
    update: ['name'],
);
```

Models with binary primary keys also accept the wrapper in Eloquent's `find`, `whereKey`, and `whereKeyNot` methods:

```php
use App\Models\Device;
use Hypervel\Database\BinaryParameter;

$device = Device::query()->find(new BinaryParameter($uuidBytes));
```

The wrapper only expresses binding intent. It does not encode or validate the value, and ordinary text strings should not be wrapped.

<a name="running-an-insert-statement"></a>
#### Running an Insert Statement

To execute an `insert` statement, you may use the `insert` method on the `DB` facade. Like `select`, this method accepts the SQL query as its first argument and bindings as its second argument:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

DB::insert('insert into users (id, name) values (?, ?)', [1, 'Marc']);
```

<a name="running-an-update-statement"></a>
#### Running an Update Statement

The `update` method should be used to update existing records in the database. The number of rows affected by the statement is returned by the method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

$affected = DB::update(
    'update users set votes = 100 where name = ?',
    ['Anita']
);
```

<a name="running-a-delete-statement"></a>
#### Running a Delete Statement

The `delete` method should be used to delete records from the database. Like `update`, the number of rows affected will be returned by the method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

$deleted = DB::delete('delete from users');
```

<a name="running-a-general-statement"></a>
#### Running a General Statement

Some database statements do not return any value. For these types of operations, you may use the `statement` method on the `DB` facade:

```php
DB::statement('drop table users');
```

<a name="running-an-unprepared-statement"></a>
#### Running an Unprepared Statement

Sometimes you may want to execute an SQL statement without binding any values. You may use the `DB` facade's `unprepared` method to accomplish this:

```php
DB::unprepared('update users set votes = 100 where name = "Dries"');
```

> [!WARNING]
> Since unprepared statements do not bind parameters, they may be vulnerable to SQL injection. You should never allow user controlled values within an unprepared statement.

<a name="implicit-commits-in-transactions"></a>
#### Implicit Commits

When using the `DB` facade's `statement` and `unprepared` methods within transactions you must be careful to avoid statements that cause [implicit commits](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html). These statements will cause the database engine to indirectly commit the entire transaction, leaving Hypervel unaware of the database's transaction level. An example of such a statement is creating a database table:

```php
DB::unprepared('create table a (col varchar(1) null)');
```

Please refer to the MySQL manual for [a list of all statements](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html) that trigger implicit commits.

<a name="using-multiple-database-connections"></a>
### Using Multiple Database Connections

If your application defines multiple connections in your `config/database.php` configuration file, you may access each connection via the `connection` method provided by the `DB` facade. The connection name passed to the `connection` method should correspond to one of the connections listed in your `config/database.php` configuration file:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

$users = DB::connection('sqlite')->select(/* ... */);
```

Hypervel applications should define database connections in the configuration file before the worker boots. Runtime connection configuration is not supported because database pools are worker-level resources and configuration mutation would affect concurrent coroutines in the same worker.

Hypervel's built-in MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite connections extend `PdoConnection`. You may access their underlying PDO instance using the `getPdo` method. Hypervel applies any registered session configuration before returning the PDO:

```php
use Hypervel\Database\PdoConnection;

$connection = DB::connection();

if ($connection instanceof PdoConnection) {
    $pdo = $connection->getPdo();
}
```

The driver-neutral `Connection` class does not expose PDO methods because native and HTTP drivers do not have a PDO instance. Code that requires direct PDO access should accept or narrow to `PdoConnection` instead of a generic connection.

If you are building a low-level PDO extension, you may use `getRawPdo` to access the connection parameter without resolving or configuring it. This value may be a PDO, a lazy connection closure, or `null`. Applications should use `getPdo` or Hypervel's query APIs instead.

<a name="listening-for-query-events"></a>
### Listening for Query Events

If you would like to specify a closure that is invoked for each SQL query executed by your application, you may use the `DB` facade's `listen` method. This method can be useful for logging queries or debugging. You may register your query listener closure in the `boot` method of a [service provider](/docs/{{version}}/providers):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Hypervel\Database\Events\QueryExecuted;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        DB::listen(function (QueryExecuted $query) {
            // $query->sql;
            // $query->bindings;
            // $query->time;
            // $query->toRawSql();
        });
    }
}
```

<a name="monitoring-cumulative-query-time"></a>
### Monitoring Cumulative Query Time

A common performance bottleneck of modern web applications is the amount of time they spend querying databases. Thankfully, Hypervel can invoke a closure or callback of your choice when it spends too much time querying the database during a single request. To get started, provide a query time threshold (in milliseconds) and closure to the `whenQueryingForLongerThan` method. You may invoke this method in the `boot` method of a [service provider](/docs/{{version}}/providers):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Hypervel\Database\Connection;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Hypervel\Database\Events\QueryExecuted;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        DB::whenQueryingForLongerThan(500, function (Connection $connection, QueryExecuted $event) {
            // Notify development team...
        });
    }
}
```

<a name="database-transactions"></a>
## Database Transactions

You may use the `transaction` method provided by the `DB` facade to run a set of operations within a database transaction. If an exception is thrown within the transaction closure, the transaction will automatically be rolled back and the exception is re-thrown. If the closure executes successfully, the transaction will automatically be committed. You don't need to worry about manually rolling back or committing while using the `transaction` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

DB::transaction(function () {
    DB::update('update users set votes = 1');

    DB::delete('delete from posts');
});
```

<a name="handling-concurrency-errors"></a>
#### Handling Concurrency Errors

The `transaction` method accepts an optional second argument which defines the number of times a transaction should be attempted. After a complete rollback, Hypervel retries detected deadlocks, serialization failures, and database lock errors. Unique constraint violations are not retried. Once the configured attempts have been exhausted, the exception will be thrown:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

DB::transaction(function () {
    DB::update('update users set votes = 1');

    DB::delete('delete from posts');
}, attempts: 5);
```

PostgreSQL and MariaDB report both an expired lock timeout and a `NOWAIT` lock failure as the same retryable error. Therefore, when a transaction allows multiple attempts, Hypervel may retry either condition on those databases. MySQL reports `NOWAIT` failures separately, and Hypervel does not retry them. Use a single attempt when a `NOWAIT` query must fail immediately without retrying.

<a name="manually-using-transactions"></a>
#### Manually Using Transactions

If you would like to begin a transaction manually and have complete control over rollbacks and commits, you may use the `beginTransaction` method provided by the `DB` facade:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\DB;

DB::beginTransaction();
```

You can rollback the transaction via the `rollBack` method:

```php
DB::rollBack();
```

Lastly, you can commit a transaction via the `commit` method:

```php
DB::commit();
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `DB` facade's transaction methods control the transactions for both the [query builder](/docs/{{version}}/queries) and [Eloquent ORM](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent).

<a name="connecting-to-the-database-cli"></a>
## Connecting to the Database CLI

If you would like to connect to your database's CLI, you may use the `db` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan db
```

If needed, you may specify a database connection name to connect to a database connection that is not the default connection:

```shell
php artisan db mysql
```

If the connection has separate read and write hosts, you may connect to either host using the `--read` or `--write` options:

```shell
php artisan db mysql --read
```

The `--read` and `--write` options understand list-style read / write configuration and host arrays. The command selects the first record for the requested side, applies that record's URL if present, and selects its first host. URL values override matching connection options, while omitted values remain inherited. A base connection with a host array also uses its first host when neither option is given.

<a name="custom-database-clients"></a>
### Custom Database Clients

Custom database drivers may support the `db` command by registering a resolver with `DatabaseCliManager` in a service provider's `boot` method. The resolver returns the executable, argument list, and optional environment variables for the client:

```php
use Hypervel\Database\DatabaseCliConfiguration;
use Hypervel\Database\DatabaseCliManager;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(DatabaseCliManager $clients): void
{
    $clients->extend('analytics', function (array $connection): DatabaseCliConfiguration {
        return new DatabaseCliConfiguration(
            command: 'analytics-client',
            arguments: [$connection['database']],
            environment: ['ANALYTICS_HOST' => $connection['host']],
        );
    });
}
```

The resolver receives the connection configuration after URL parsing, read/write selection, and host-list selection. It is called once per command invocation and does not need to open a database connection. Validate any requirements specific to your client in the resolver; a client that uses a local file or socket does not need a host.

Pass arguments as separate list entries, not a shell command string. Use the environment map for credentials when the client supports it. Both arguments and environment variables default to empty arrays.

Resolvers remain registered for the worker lifetime, so register them only during application boot. Registering a resolver for a built-in driver replaces its client configuration. Otherwise, built-in drivers continue through `DbCommand`'s existing argument and environment helpers, including any subclass overrides.

<a name="inspecting-your-databases"></a>
## Inspecting Your Databases

Using the `db:show` and `db:table` Artisan commands, you can get valuable insight into your database and its associated tables. To see an overview of your database, including its size, type, number of open connections, and a summary of its tables, you may use the `db:show` command:

```shell
php artisan db:show
```

You may specify which database connection should be inspected by providing the database connection name to the command via the `--database` option:

```shell
php artisan db:show --database=pgsql
```

If you would like to include table row counts and database view details within the output of the command, you may provide the `--counts` and `--views` options, respectively. On large databases, retrieving row counts and view details can be slow:

```shell
php artisan db:show --counts --views
```

The `db:show` command may also return JSON output using the `--json` option. If you would like to include user-defined database types in the output, you may provide the `--types` option.

In addition, you may use the following `Schema` methods to inspect your database:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Schema;

$tables = Schema::getTables();
$views = Schema::getViews();
$types = Schema::getTypes();
$columns = Schema::getColumns('users');
$indexes = Schema::getIndexes('users');
$foreignKeys = Schema::getForeignKeys('users');
```

If you would like to inspect a database connection that is not your application's default connection, you may use the `connection` method:

```php
$columns = Schema::connection('sqlite')->getColumns('users');
```

<a name="table-overview"></a>
#### Table Overview

If you would like to get an overview of an individual table within your database, you may execute the `db:table` Artisan command. This command provides a general overview of a database table, including its columns, types, attributes, keys, and indexes:

```shell
php artisan db:table users
```

If you do not provide a table name, Hypervel will prompt you to select a table to inspect. You may also specify a database connection using the `--database` option or return JSON output using the `--json` option:

```shell
php artisan db:table users --database=pgsql --json
```

<a name="monitoring-your-databases"></a>
## Monitoring Your Databases

Using the `db:monitor` Artisan command, you can instruct Hypervel to dispatch a `Hypervel\Database\Events\DatabaseBusy` event if your database is managing more than a specified number of open connections.

To get started, you should schedule the `db:monitor` command to [run every minute](/docs/{{version}}/scheduling). The command accepts the names of the database connection configurations that you wish to monitor as well as the maximum number of open connections that should be tolerated before dispatching an event:

```shell
php artisan db:monitor --databases=mysql,pgsql --max=100
```

Scheduling this command alone is not enough to trigger a notification alerting you of the number of open connections. When the command encounters a database that has an open connection count that exceeds your threshold, a `DatabaseBusy` event will be dispatched. You should listen for this event within your application's `AppServiceProvider` in order to send a notification to you or your development team:

```php
use App\Notifications\DatabaseApproachingMaxConnections;
use Hypervel\Database\Events\DatabaseBusy;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Event;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Notification;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Event::listen(function (DatabaseBusy $event) {
        Notification::route('mail', 'dev@example.com')
            ->notify(new DatabaseApproachingMaxConnections(
                $event->connectionName,
                $event->connections
            ));
    });
}
```
