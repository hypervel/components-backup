## Introduction

Hypervel is built with testing in mind. In fact, support for testing with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) is included out of the box and a `phpunit.xml` file is already set up for your application. The framework also ships with convenient helper methods that allow you to expressively test your applications.

By default, your application's `tests` directory contains two directories: `Feature` and `Unit`. Unit tests are tests that focus on a very small, isolated portion of your code. In fact, most unit tests probably focus on a single method. When a unit test does not need the framework booted, you may mark that method with `#[UnitTest]` to keep it inside Hypervel's testing infrastructure while skipping the application boot for that method.

Feature tests may test a larger portion of your code, including how several objects interact with each other or even a full HTTP request to a JSON endpoint. **Generally, most of your tests should be feature tests. These types of tests provide the most confidence that your system as a whole is functioning as intended.**

An `ExampleTest.php` file is provided in both the `Feature` and `Unit` test directories. After installing a new Hypervel application, execute the `vendor/bin/phpunit` or `php artisan test` commands to run your tests.

<a name="environment"></a>
## Environment

When running tests, Hypervel will automatically set the [configuration environment](/docs/{{version}}/configuration#environment-configuration) to `testing` because of the environment variables defined in the `phpunit.xml` file. Hypervel also automatically configures the session and cache to the `array` driver so that no session or cache data will be persisted while testing.

You are free to define other testing environment configuration values as necessary. The `testing` environment variables may be configured in your application's `phpunit.xml` file, but make sure to clear your configuration cache using the `config:clear` Artisan command before running your tests!

<a name="the-env-testing-environment-file"></a>
#### The `.env.testing` Environment File

In addition, you may create a `.env.testing` file in the root of your project. This file will be used instead of the `.env` file when running PHPUnit tests or executing Artisan commands with the `--env=testing` option.

<a name="creating-tests"></a>
## Creating Tests

To create a new test case, use the `make:test` Artisan command. By default, tests will be placed in the `tests/Feature` directory:

```shell
php artisan make:test UserTest
```

If you would like to create a test within the `tests/Unit` directory, you may use the `--unit` option when executing the `make:test` command:

```shell
php artisan make:test UserTest --unit
```

<a name="choosing-a-test-case"></a>
### Choosing a Test Case

Application tests should extend your application's `Tests\TestCase` class. A method that does not need the application may use the `#[UnitTest]` attribute to skip booting it while retaining Hypervel's coroutine and cleanup lifecycle. The attribute only applies to application test bases; `Hypervel\Testing\UnitTestCase` never boots an application.

Packages and library monopackages may own a thin base test case that extends `Hypervel\Testing\UnitTestCase` when their tests do not need an application:

```shell
composer require hypervel/testing --dev
```

```php
<?php

namespace Courier\Tests;

use Hypervel\Testing\UnitTestCase as BaseTestCase;

abstract class UnitTestCase extends BaseTestCase
{
    //
}
```

This base runs each test method inside a coroutine, provides environment-variable helpers, and handles exception-handler state and the Mockery lifecycle without booting an application. Register Hypervel's [PHPUnit extension](#test-state-cleanup) in your package's `phpunit.xml` file so framework state is reset after each test. Package tests that need the container, configuration, service providers, database, routes, or an application filesystem should instead extend [`Hypervel\Testbench\TestCase`](/docs/{{version}}/testbench#getting-started).

PHPUnit unit tests generated by `make:test --unit` include the `#[UnitTest]` attribute by default, so the generated example runs without booting the application while still running inside Hypervel's coroutine wrapper:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Unit;

use Hypervel\Foundation\Testing\Attributes\UnitTest;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic test example.
     */
    #[UnitTest]
    public function test_basic_test(): void
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

If a generated unit test needs the application container, facades, database, or other framework services, remove the `#[UnitTest]` attribute from that method.

If you have a test class that mostly relies on Hypervel's testing features, but a specific test method does not need the framework booted, you may apply the `#[UnitTest]` attribute to that method to skip booting the application for just that test.

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Hypervel\Foundation\Testing\Attributes\UnitTest;
use Tests\TestCase;

class LocationServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_get_coordinates_resolves_address(): void
    {
        // This test uses Hypervel's testing features...
    }

    #[UnitTest]
    public function test_get_state_returns_state_from_abbreviation(): void
    {
        // This test runs without booting the application...
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Test stubs may be customized using [stub publishing](/docs/{{version}}/artisan#stub-customization).

> [!WARNING]
> If you define your own `setUp` / `tearDown` methods within a test class, be sure to call the respective `parent::setUp()` / `parent::tearDown()` methods on the parent class. Typically, you should invoke `parent::setUp()` at the start of your own `setUp` method, and `parent::tearDown()` at the end of your `tearDown` method.

<a name="reusable-test-traits"></a>
### Reusable Test Traits

When a test boots the application, its reusable traits may mark setup and cleanup methods with the `Hypervel\Foundation\Testing\Attributes\SetUp` and `Hypervel\Foundation\Testing\Attributes\TearDown` attributes. Hypervel runs these methods after creating the application and before destroying it, respectively. The conventional `setUp{TraitName}` and `tearDown{TraitName}` method names are also supported.

These hooks run outside the test method's coroutine; use `setUp{TraitName}InCoroutine` or `tearDown{TraitName}InCoroutine` when a trait needs to share the test's [coroutine context](#running-tests-in-coroutines).

<a name="running-tests-in-coroutines"></a>
### Running Tests in Coroutines

Hypervel runs on Swoole, so framework services such as database pools, Redis pools, coroutine context, and request-scoped state expect to execute inside a coroutine. Your application's `Tests\TestCase`, `Hypervel\Testing\UnitTestCase`, and `Hypervel\Testbench\TestCase` all include the `RunTestsInCoroutine` trait and automatically wrap each test method in a coroutine container.

Most tests should keep Hypervel's coroutine wrapper enabled. If a test intentionally verifies behavior outside Hypervel's coroutine runtime, set the `$runTestsInCoroutine` property to `false` on the test class:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Unit;

use Hypervel\Coroutine\Coroutine;
use Tests\TestCase;

class NonCoroutineRuntimeTest extends TestCase
{
    protected bool $runTestsInCoroutine = false;

    public function test_code_runs_outside_a_coroutine(): void
    {
        $this->assertSame(-1, Coroutine::id());
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> PHPUnit's output assertions currently cannot capture output printed inside Hypervel's test coroutine. If the test does not need coroutine execution, set `$runTestsInCoroutine = false`; otherwise, an output assertion may incorrectly pass. This issue is tracked in [PHPUnit #7039](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/7039).

The standard PHPUnit `setUp` and `tearDown` methods run outside the test method's coroutine. If your setup or teardown work needs to share the same coroutine-aware lifecycle as the test method, define `setUpInCoroutine` or `tearDownInCoroutine` methods:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Hypervel\Context\CoroutineContext;
use Tests\TestCase;

class AuthContextTest extends TestCase
{
    protected function setUpInCoroutine(): void
    {
        CoroutineContext::set('auth_context.users.foo', 'John');
    }

    protected function tearDownInCoroutine(): void
    {
        CoroutineContext::forget('auth_context.users.foo');
    }

    public function test_context_value_is_available(): void
    {
        $this->assertSame('John', CoroutineContext::get('auth_context.users.foo'));
    }
}
```

By default, Hypervel copies coroutine context values prepared outside the test method into the coroutine that runs the test. This allows setup work performed by the testing lifecycle, including database transaction setup, to remain visible to the test method. If you need a test class to start with an isolated coroutine context, set `$copyNonCoroutineContext` to `false`:

```php
protected bool $copyNonCoroutineContext = false;
```

<a name="request-context"></a>
### Request Context

Hypervel's HTTP testing methods automatically populate the request context for you. Tests that call the `request` helper without making an HTTP request are different: no request exists in the current context, so Hypervel builds a fresh fallback request from your application's configured URL every time the helper runs. Any change you make to one of those requests, such as calling `request()->merge(...)`, will not be visible to the next `request()` call.

If a test needs a stable request, create one and store it in the request context:

```php
use Hypervel\Context\RequestContext;
use Hypervel\Http\Request;

RequestContext::set(Request::create('/?name=John'));

$this->assertSame('John', request('name'));
```

The request is stored in the current coroutine's context, so it is discarded when the test finishes and will not leak into other tests. If several tests need the same request, you may set it in the `setUpInCoroutine` method.

<a name="owning-asynchronous-test-resources"></a>
### Owning Asynchronous Test Resources

Tests that create child coroutines, subscribers, processes, servers, or other asynchronous resources must close or join those resources in a `finally` block. This ensures that assertion failures and other exceptions cannot leave work running after the test has finished.

When a test needs results or exceptions from child coroutines, prefer the `parallel` helper instead of coordinating them with unbounded channel reads. Use channels directly when channel behavior is what the test is exercising.

Swoole tables are also resources your test owns. Swoole only releases a table's memory when `destroy` is called, so a table created in a test stays in memory until the test process exits. When a test creates a Swoole table, use the `InteractsWithSwooleTables` trait and pass the table to `trackSwooleTable`. The trait destroys tracked tables after each test, so you should not call `destroy` on them yourself.

<a name="test-state-cleanup"></a>
### Test State Cleanup

Hypervel applications keep framework objects, static caches, macros, and manager state in memory for the life of the PHP process. During tests, Hypervel's PHPUnit extension flushes framework-owned state after every test method. New applications register this extension in their `phpunit.xml` file. Packages should register it in their own `phpunit.xml` file:

```xml
<extensions>
    <bootstrap class="Hypervel\Testing\PHPUnit\AfterEachTestExtension" />
</extensions>
```

Hypervel also verifies and closes Mockery automatically. Framework base test cases perform verification during teardown so unmet expectations are attributed to the test that created them, while the PHPUnit extension provides fallback verification for tests using another base case. Individual tests should not call `Mockery::close()` themselves.

If your application has its own worker-lifetime state, add its cleanup to `tests/Support/TestState.php`. Use this class as one application-level entry point that aggregates the cleanup for any stateful classes your app owns:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Support;

use Hypervel\Testing\PHPUnit\AfterEachTestCleanup;

class TestState
{
    public static function register(): void
    {
        AfterEachTestCleanup::flushUsing('app', fn () => static::flushState());
    }

    public static function flushState(): void
    {
        InvoiceNumbers::flushState();
        TaxRates::flushState();
        ReceiptMacros::flushState();
    }
}
```

Callbacks registered by your application run after package cleanup callbacks and before Hypervel flushes framework static state. The test application has already been destroyed at this point, so these callbacks must clean process-local state directly and must not resolve container services. Use the appropriate testing trait to clean up external resources.

Do not call `AfterEachTestCleanup::forgetCallbacks()` from ordinary application tests. That method clears all registered callbacks for the current PHPUnit worker, including callbacks discovered from application and package metadata.

To remove a specific callback that your test registered, call `AfterEachTestCleanup::forget($name)` instead.

For static state owned by a particular application base test case, you may override its protected `flushState` method. Call `parent::flushState()` in your override. This hook runs after the test application is destroyed, so it must not resolve container services. Tests marked `#[UnitTest]` skip this hook; use the shared `TestState` registration above for cleanup that must also run after those methods:

```php
protected function flushState(): void
{
    parent::flushState();

    InvoiceNumbers::flushState();
}
```

<a name="macro-state"></a>
### Macro State

Macroable classes store registered macros in static state for the life of the PHP process. Typically, macros should be registered during application boot from a [service provider](/docs/{{version}}/providers).

Hypervel already flushes framework macroable classes such as `Collection`, `ResponseFactory`, `View\Factory`, and testing helpers after every test. Do not add teardown cleanup for framework classes already handled by Hypervel.

If your application or package defines its own macroable class and registers temporary macros inside a test, add that class to your test-state cleanup.

<a name="using-pest"></a>
### Using Pest

Pest is not installed, officially supported, or tested by Hypervel 0.4.

If you choose to install and configure Pest yourself, ensure tests that touch Hypervel services use your application's coroutine-aware `Tests\TestCase` class. Otherwise, those tests will not run through Hypervel's coroutine testing lifecycle, and services such as database pools, Redis pools, and coroutine context may not behave correctly.

<a name="running-tests"></a>
## Running Tests

As mentioned previously, once you've written tests, you may run them using `phpunit`:

```shell
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

In addition to the `phpunit` command, you may use the `test` Artisan command to run your tests. The Artisan test runner provides verbose test reports in order to ease development and debugging:

```shell
php artisan test
```

Any arguments that can be passed to the `phpunit` command may also be passed to the Artisan `test` command:

```shell
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature --stop-on-failure
```

<a name="running-tests-in-parallel"></a>
### Running Tests in Parallel

By default, Hypervel and PHPUnit execute your tests sequentially within a single process. However, you may greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to run your tests by running tests simultaneously across multiple processes. Hypervel's application skeleton includes the `brianium/paratest` Composer package as a development dependency, so you may include the `--parallel` option when executing the `test` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan test --parallel
```

By default, Hypervel will create as many processes as there are available CPU cores on your machine. However, you may adjust the number of processes using the `--processes` option:

```shell
php artisan test --parallel --processes=4
```

> [!WARNING]
> When running tests in parallel, some PHPUnit options (such as `--do-not-record-test-run-history`) may not be available.

<a name="parallel-testing-and-databases"></a>
#### Parallel Testing and Databases

As long as you have configured a primary database connection, Hypervel automatically handles creating and migrating a test database for each parallel process that is running your tests. Connections configured with a database URL are normalized before the test database name is applied. The test databases will be suffixed with a process token which is unique per process. For example, if you have two parallel test processes, Hypervel will create and use `your_db_test_1` and `your_db_test_2` test databases.

SQLite URI databases cannot be automatically isolated for parallel testing. Configure a plain filesystem path, or use the `--without-databases` option.

Read and write endpoints that define their own `database` or `url` values cannot be automatically isolated either. Configure the endpoints to inherit one database identity from the primary connection, or use the `--without-databases` option.

By default, test databases persist between calls to the `test` Artisan command so that they can be used again by subsequent `test` invocations. However, you may re-create them using the `--recreate-databases` option:

```shell
php artisan test --parallel --recreate-databases
```

If you would like Hypervel to drop the test databases after the parallel test run completes, use the `--drop-databases` option:

```shell
php artisan test --parallel --drop-databases
```

To disable automatic test database configuration, use `--without-databases`. To keep cache and rate limiter prefixes unchanged, use `--without-cache`:

```shell
php artisan test --parallel --without-databases --without-cache
```

<a name="external-service-tests"></a>
#### External Service Tests

Integration tests that use an external service must use that service's test trait.

| Trait | Service | Key Environment Variables |
|-------|---------|---------------------------|
| `InteractsWithRedis` | Redis / Redis Cluster / Valkey | `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_CLUSTER_HOSTS_AND_PORTS` |
| `InteractsWithMeilisearch` | Meilisearch | `MEILISEARCH_HOST`, `MEILISEARCH_PORT`, `MEILISEARCH_KEY` |
| `InteractsWithTypesense` | Typesense | `TYPESENSE_HOST`, `TYPESENSE_PORT`, `TYPESENSE_API_KEY`, `TYPESENSE_PROTOCOL` |
| `InteractsWithAlgolia` | Algolia | `ALGOLIA_APP_ID`, `ALGOLIA_SECRET` |
| `InteractsWithServer` | Engine test servers | `TEST_SERVER_HOST` |

The Meilisearch, Typesense, and Algolia traits require their corresponding client package: `meilisearch/meilisearch-php`, `typesense/typesense-php`, or `algolia/algoliasearch-client-php`.

This applies whether the test calls the service directly or reaches it through the application or package code under test.

These traits are required for external-service tests to work correctly under ParaTest. Parallel test workers share external services unless the trait isolates them. Tests that bypass the trait will leak state across workers and fail depending on timing.

The traits handle service-specific setup and cleanup. If a service is not configured, the trait skips the test before connecting. If the service is configured but unreachable or misconfigured, the test fails.

The search traits create a worker-specific prefix from `TEST_TOKEN`. Prefix test indexes and collections with `$this->meilisearchTestPrefix`, `$this->typesenseTestPrefix`, or `$this->algoliaTestPrefix`. Cleanup only removes resources that start with the matching prefix.

<a name="parallel-testing-and-redis"></a>
#### Parallel Testing and Redis

Tests that touch Redis must use `InteractsWithRedis`.

Set `REDIS_HOST` to run Redis integration tests against a standalone Redis or Valkey server. When tests are not running in parallel, `InteractsWithRedis` uses your normal configured Redis database. When tests are running in parallel, it assigns each ParaTest worker its own Redis database and flushes it before and after each test. This isolates the test keyspace without changing the Redis behavior being tested.

To run Redis integration tests against Redis Cluster, set `REDIS_CLUSTER_HOSTS_AND_PORTS` to a comma-separated list of Cluster nodes:

```ini
REDIS_CLUSTER_HOSTS_AND_PORTS=127.0.0.1:7000,127.0.0.1:7001,127.0.0.1:7002
```

Redis Cluster does not support logical databases. Cluster integration tests therefore use database zero and must run serially. The database is flushed before and after each test.

Parallel Redis databases are selected from the `REDIS_TEST_DB_MIN` and `REDIS_TEST_DB_MAX` environment variables. By default, `REDIS_TEST_DB_MIN` uses your configured `REDIS_DB` value and `REDIS_TEST_DB_MAX` is `15`:

```ini
REDIS_DB=1
REDIS_TEST_DB_MIN=1
REDIS_TEST_DB_MAX=15
```

If Hypervel cannot assign a Redis database to a worker, the test run will fail. ParaTest uses your machine's CPU count by default, so make sure your Redis test range covers the number of workers you are running or pass an explicit process count:

```shell
php artisan test --parallel --processes=4
```

Some low-level standalone Redis tests may need to switch to a second Redis database with `select`. You may reserve that database using `REDIS_TEST_SECONDARY_DB`:

```ini
REDIS_TEST_SECONDARY_DB=15
```

When a secondary database is configured inside the worker range, Hypervel skips it when assigning worker databases. Tests that use a shared secondary database should use unique keys and delete them when the test finishes.

<a name="parallel-testing-hooks"></a>
#### Parallel Testing Hooks

Occasionally, you may need to prepare certain resources used by your application's tests so they may be safely used by multiple test processes.

Using the `ParallelTesting` facade, you may specify code to be executed on the `setUp` and `tearDown` of a process or test case. The given closures receive the `$token` and `$testCase` variables that contain the process token and the current test case, respectively:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\ParallelTesting;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        ParallelTesting::setUpProcess(function (string $token) {
            // ...
        });

        ParallelTesting::setUpTestCase(function (string $token, TestCase $testCase) {
            // ...
        });

        // Executed after a test database is created and before migrations run...
        ParallelTesting::setUpTestDatabaseBeforeMigrating(function (string $database, string $token) {
            // ...
        });

        // Executed when a test database has been migrated...
        ParallelTesting::setUpTestDatabase(function (string $database, string $token) {
            Artisan::call('db:seed');
        });

        ParallelTesting::tearDownTestCase(function (string $token, TestCase $testCase) {
            // ...
        });

        ParallelTesting::tearDownProcess(function (string $token) {
            // ...
        });
    }
}
```

<a name="accessing-the-parallel-testing-token"></a>
#### Accessing the Parallel Testing Token

If you would like to access the current parallel process "token" from any other location in your application's test code, you may use the `token` method. This token is a unique, string identifier for an individual test process and may be used to segment resources across parallel test processes. For example, Hypervel automatically appends this token to the end of the test databases created by each parallel testing process:

    $token = ParallelTesting::token();

When working with temporary files in parallel tests, you may use the `tempDir` method to generate a per-worker temporary directory:

    $path = ParallelTesting::tempDir('images');

<a name="reporting-test-coverage"></a>
### Reporting Test Coverage

> [!WARNING]
> This feature requires [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org) or [PCOV](https://pecl.php.net/package/pcov).

When running your application tests, you may want to determine whether your test cases are actually covering the application code and how much application code is used when running your tests. To accomplish this, you may provide the `--coverage` option when invoking the `test` command:

```shell
php artisan test --coverage
```

<a name="enforcing-a-minimum-coverage-threshold"></a>
#### Enforcing a Minimum Coverage Threshold

You may use the `--min` option to define a minimum test coverage threshold for your application. The test suite will fail if this threshold is not met:

```shell
php artisan test --coverage --min=80.3
```

<a name="profiling-tests"></a>
### Profiling Tests

The Artisan test runner also includes a convenient mechanism for listing your application's slowest tests. Invoke the `test` command with the `--profile` option to be presented with a list of your ten slowest tests, allowing you to easily investigate which tests can be improved to speed up your test suite:

```shell
php artisan test --profile
```

Packages that run ParaTest directly may use the profiler included with the `hypervel/testing` package. Except for `--log-junit`, the command forwards ParaTest options, files, and directories. Test paths are resolved from your project's root. The output lists every test whose setup, execution, and teardown meet the displayed slow-test threshold:

```shell
./vendor/bin/hypervel-test-profile --processes=4 tests/Feature
```

<a name="configuration-caching"></a>
## Configuration Caching

When running tests, Hypervel boots the application for each individual test method. Without a cached configuration file, each configuration file in your application must be loaded at the start of a test. To build the configuration once and re-use it for all tests in a single run, you may use the `Hypervel\Foundation\Testing\WithCachedConfig` trait:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Hypervel\Foundation\Testing\WithCachedConfig;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ConfigTest extends TestCase
{
    use WithCachedConfig;

    // ...
}
```
