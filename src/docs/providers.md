## Introduction

Service providers are the central place of all Hypervel application bootstrapping. Your own application, as well as all of Hypervel's core services, are bootstrapped via service providers.

But, what do we mean by "bootstrapped"? In general, we mean **registering** things, including registering service container bindings, event listeners, middleware, and even routes. Service providers are the central place to configure your application.

Hypervel uses dozens of service providers internally to bootstrap its core services, such as the mailer, queue, cache, and others. In an HTTP server context, service providers are registered and booted before the Swoole server forks its workers. The workers inherit the registered services, listeners, middleware, routes, and other application state. Providers are not registered or booted again for each worker or request.

In a typical Hypervel application, user-defined service providers are registered in the `bootstrap/providers.php` file. In the following documentation, you will learn how to write your own service providers and register them with your Hypervel application.

## Writing Service Providers

All service providers extend the `Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider` class. Most service providers contain a `register` and a `boot` method. Within the `register` method, you should **only bind things into the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container)**. You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the `register` method.

The Artisan CLI can generate a new provider via the `make:provider` command. Hypervel will automatically register your new provider in your application's `bootstrap/providers.php` file:

```shell
php artisan make:provider RiakServiceProvider
```

<a name="the-register-method"></a>
### The Register Method

As mentioned previously, within the `register` method, you should only bind things into the [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container). You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the `register` method. Otherwise, you may accidentally use a service that is provided by a service provider which has not loaded yet.

Let's take a look at a basic service provider. Within any of your service provider methods, you always have access to the `$app` property which provides access to the service container:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Services\Riak\Connection;
use Hypervel\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class RiakServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->singleton(Connection::class, function (Application $app) {
            return new Connection(config()->array('riak'));
        });
    }
}
```

This service provider only defines a `register` method, and uses that method to define an implementation of `App\Services\Riak\Connection` in the service container. If you're not yet familiar with Hypervel's service container, check out [its documentation](/docs/{{version}}/container).

<a name="the-bindings-and-singletons-properties"></a>
#### The `bindings` and `singletons` Properties

If your service provider registers many simple bindings, you may wish to use the `bindings` and `singletons` properties instead of manually registering each container binding. When the service provider is loaded by the framework, it will automatically check for these properties and register their bindings:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Contracts\DowntimeNotifier;
use App\Contracts\ServerProvider;
use App\Services\DigitalOceanServerProvider;
use App\Services\PingdomDowntimeNotifier;
use App\Services\ServerToolsProvider;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * All of the container bindings that should be registered.
     */
    public array $bindings = [
        ServerProvider::class => DigitalOceanServerProvider::class,
    ];

    /**
     * All of the container singletons that should be registered.
     */
    public array $singletons = [
        DowntimeNotifier::class => PingdomDowntimeNotifier::class,
        ServerProvider::class => ServerToolsProvider::class,
    ];
}
```

<a name="merging-configuration"></a>
#### Merging Configuration

Package service providers may merge their default configuration into the application's configuration using the `mergeConfigFrom` method. This is typically done within the `register` method:

```php
/**
 * Register any application services.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->mergeConfigFrom(
        __DIR__.'/../config/riak.php', 'riak'
    );
}
```

By default, configuration is merged at the top level. If your configuration contains arrays that should allow applications to add new entries without replacing the entire array, override the `mergeableOptions` method:

```php
/**
 * Get the options within the configuration that should be merged.
 *
 * @return array<int, string>
 */
protected function mergeableOptions(string $name): array
{
    return $name === 'riak' ? ['connections'] : [];
}
```

In this example, the application's `riak.connections` entries will be merged with the package's default connections. Entries with the same key will still be replaced by the application's configuration.

If you need to recursively replace nested configuration values, you may use the `replaceConfigRecursivelyFrom` method instead:

```php
/**
 * Register any application services.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->replaceConfigRecursivelyFrom(
        __DIR__.'/../config/riak.php', 'riak'
    );
}
```

When a configuration value is computed from other configuration values, set it using the `configureUsing` method. Each worker rebuilds its configuration when it starts, so the callback runs again against the rebuilt configuration instead of keeping the value it first computed. When your application's configuration is cached, the cached file already holds the value, so the callback does not run:

```php
use Hypervel\Contracts\Config\Repository;

/**
 * Register any application services.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->mergeConfigFrom(__DIR__.'/../config/riak.php', 'riak');

    $this->configureUsing(function (Repository $config) {
        $config->set('riak.buffer_bytes', $config->integer('riak.record_bytes') * 4);
    });
}
```

<a name="the-boot-method"></a>
### The Boot Method

So, what if we need to register a [view composer](/docs/{{version}}/views#view-composers) within our service provider? This should be done within the `boot` method. **This method is called after all other service providers have been registered**, meaning you have access to all other services that have been registered by the framework:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Hypervel\Support\Facades\View;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class ComposerServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        View::composer('view', function () {
            // ...
        });
    }
}
```

<a name="boot-method-dependency-injection"></a>
#### Boot Method Dependency Injection

You may type-hint dependencies for your service provider's `boot` method. The [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container) will automatically inject any dependencies you need:

```php
use Hypervel\Contracts\Routing\ResponseFactory;

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(ResponseFactory $response): void
{
    $response->macro('serialized', function (mixed $value) {
        // ...
    });
}
```

<a name="service-providers-and-long-running-workers"></a>
### Service Providers and Long-Running Workers

Hypervel applications run in long-lived Swoole worker processes. The server application registers and boots its service providers before these workers are forked, so provider properties and singleton state are inherited and may be reused by every request handled by a worker.

For this reason, you should not store request-specific state, such as the current user, tenant, request, or response, on a service provider property or singleton service. Store request-specific state in the request, [context](/docs/{{version}}/context), or the lower-level [coroutine context](/docs/{{version}}/coroutine-context).

<a name="conditionally-loading-providers"></a>
### Conditionally Loading Providers

You may prevent a service provider from being registered or booted by overriding the `isEnabled` method. This is useful for packages that are installed in many applications but should only load in some of them:

```php
/**
 * Determine whether this provider should be registered and booted.
 */
public function isEnabled(): bool
{
    return config()->boolean('modules.riak.enabled', false);
}
```

Hypervel calls `isEnabled` before the provider's `register` method, so configuration merged by that provider is not available yet. You may read configuration that the application or framework has already loaded. When an unpublished package option is intentionally optional, as in the example above, provide its fallback here.

When this method returns `false`, the provider's `register` and `boot` methods will not be called, its `bindings` and `singletons` properties will not be processed, and the provider will not be marked as loaded.

<a name="advanced-provider-apis"></a>
### Advanced Provider APIs

Package service providers may also register AOP aspects and class map overrides. These methods should be called within the `register` method before the target classes are loaded:

```php
use App\Aspects\TraceRequests;
use App\Services\Riak\Client;

/**
 * Register any application services.
 */
public function register(): void
{
    $this->aspects([
        TraceRequests::class,
    ]);

    $this->classMap([
        Client::class => __DIR__.'/../Overrides/RiakClient.php',
    ]);
}
```

- `$this->aspects(...)` registers AOP aspect classes. See [AOP](/docs/{{version}}/aop) for writing aspects.
- `$this->classMap(...)` swaps a class's source file at autoload time, before it is loaded. See [Class Map Overrides](/docs/{{version}}/packages#class-map-overrides).

<a name="registering-providers"></a>
## Registering Providers

Application service providers are registered in the `bootstrap/providers.php` configuration file. This file returns an array that contains the class names of your application's service providers:

```php
<?php

return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
];
```

The default `bootstrap/app.php` file loads these providers through the `withProviders` method. You may also pass provider class names directly to the `withProviders` method:

```php
use Hypervel\Foundation\Application;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withProviders([
        App\Providers\ComposerServiceProvider::class,
    ])
    ->create();
```

When you invoke the `make:provider` Artisan command, Hypervel will automatically add the generated provider to the `bootstrap/providers.php` file. However, if you have manually created the provider class, you should manually add the provider class to the array:

```php
<?php

return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\ComposerServiceProvider::class, // [tl! add]
];
```

Package service providers are typically registered using package discovery. To learn more about package discovery, consult the [package development documentation](/docs/{{version}}/packages#package-discovery).

<a name="provider-priority"></a>
### Provider Priority

Auto-discovered package providers may define a `priority` property to control their registration order relative to other discovered package providers. Providers default to a priority of `0`. Providers with a higher priority are registered first:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class RiakServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * The registration priority for this provider.
     */
    public int $priority = 10;
}
```

Provider priority only applies to auto-discovered package providers. Framework providers are always registered before discovered package providers, and application providers are registered after them.

> [!NOTE]
> Hypervel does not support deferred service providers. Provider registration and booting happen once before the server forks its workers, so their cost is shared across the lifetime of those workers instead of being paid for every request.
