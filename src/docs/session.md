## Introduction

Since HTTP driven applications are stateless, sessions provide a way to store information about the user across multiple requests. That user information is typically placed in a persistent store / backend that can be accessed from subsequent requests.

Hypervel ships with a variety of session backends that are accessed through an expressive, unified API. Support for popular backends such as [Redis](https://redis.io), files, and databases is included.

<a name="configuration"></a>
### Configuration

Your application's session configuration file is stored at `config/session.php`. Be sure to review the options available to you in this file. By default, Hypervel is configured to use the `database` session driver. If your application will be load balanced across multiple servers, you should choose a centralized store that all servers can access, such as Redis or a database. Redis is recommended for maximum performance and scalability.

The session `driver` configuration option defines where session data will be stored for each request. Hypervel includes a variety of drivers:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- `file` - sessions are stored in `storage/framework/sessions`.
- `cookie` - sessions are stored in secure, encrypted cookies.
- `database` - sessions are stored in a relational database.
- `redis` - sessions are stored directly in Redis.
- `array` - sessions are stored in a PHP array and will not be persisted.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> The array driver stores sessions only in the memory of a single Swoole worker. It is useful during [testing](/docs/{{version}}/testing), but should not be used for production sessions.

By default, Hypervel serializes session data as JSON, which is suitable for scalar and array values. If your application needs to store PHP objects in the session, you may set the `serialization` option in your `session.php` configuration file to `php`. PHP serialization should only be enabled when necessary, since deserializing objects increases the impact of compromised session data or encryption keys.

Routes assigned to the `web` middleware group already include the `Hypervel\Session\Middleware\StartSession` middleware. If you need session state on routes outside of the `web` middleware group, you should apply the middleware to those routes.

<a name="driver-prerequisites"></a>
### Driver Prerequisites

<a name="database"></a>
#### Database

When using the `database` session driver, you will need to ensure that you have a database table to contain the session data. Typically, a `sessions` table is included in Hypervel's default [database migrations](/docs/{{version}}/migrations); however, if for any reason you do not have a `sessions` table, you may use the `make:session-table` Artisan command to generate this migration:

```shell
php artisan make:session-table

php artisan migrate
```

The `session:table` command is also available as an alias for `make:session-table`.

Hypervel's generated sessions table uses a nullable, indexed string for the `user_id` column so integer, UUID, ULID, and application-defined identifiers are supported. The nullable `auth_provider` column keeps sessions for authentication providers that use the same user identifiers separate. The `ip_address` column is created using the `ipAddress` column type, which uses the native `inet` type on PostgreSQL. Applications created with an older sessions migration should update these columns before managing user sessions.

<a name="redis"></a>
#### Redis

Before using Redis sessions with Hypervel, install the [PhpRedis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) PHP extension using [PIE](https://github.com/php/pie):

```shell
pie install phpredis/phpredis
```

For more information on configuring Redis, consult Hypervel's [Redis documentation](/docs/{{version}}/redis#configuration).

> [!NOTE]
> The `SESSION_CONNECTION` environment variable, or the `connection` option in the `session.php` configuration file, may be used to specify which Redis connection is used for session storage.

Redis session keys use the `SESSION_PREFIX` environment variable and default to your application ID followed by `_session:`. The session prefix is separate from `SESSION_CONNECTION`: the connection selects where sessions are stored, while the prefix separates session keys from other data on that connection. Any prefix configured on the Redis connection will also be applied.

Redis stores session payloads directly rather than routing them through a cache store. Reads always use one Redis command. With user-session tracking disabled, writes and deletions also use one command. Tracking-enabled standalone Redis coordinates the payload and user index in one atomic operation, while Redis Cluster uses separate cross-slot operations.

To list and invalidate a user's Redis sessions, enable `SESSION_TRACK_USER_SESSIONS`. This feature requires phpredis 6.3.0 or later and Redis 8.0 or Valkey 9.0 or later. You may leave this option disabled if your application does not provide session-management controls.

<a name="interacting-with-the-session"></a>
## Interacting With the Session

<a name="retrieving-data"></a>
### Retrieving Data

There are two primary ways of working with session data in Hypervel: the global `session` helper and via a `Request` instance. First, let's look at accessing the session via a `Request` instance, which can be type-hinted on a route closure or controller method. Remember, controller method dependencies are automatically injected via the Hypervel [service container](/docs/{{version}}/container):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\View\View;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Show the profile for the given user.
     */
    public function show(Request $request, string $id): View
    {
        $value = $request->session()->get('key');

        // ...

        $user = $this->users->find($id);

        return view('user.profile', ['user' => $user]);
    }
}
```

When you retrieve an item from the session, you may also pass a default value as the second argument to the `get` method. This default value will be returned if the specified key does not exist in the session. If you pass a closure as the default value to the `get` method and the requested key does not exist, the closure will be executed and its result returned:

```php
$value = $request->session()->get('key', 'default');

$value = $request->session()->get('key', function () {
    return 'default';
});
```

<a name="the-global-session-helper"></a>
#### The Global Session Helper

You may also use the global `session` PHP function to retrieve and store data in the session. When the `session` helper is called with a single string or enum argument, it will return the value of that session key. When the helper is called with an array of key / value pairs, those values will be stored in the session:

```php
Route::get('/home', function () {
    // Retrieve a piece of data from the session...
    $value = session('key');

    // Specifying a default value...
    $value = session('key', 'default');

    // Store a piece of data in the session...
    session(['key' => 'value']);
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is little practical difference between using the session via an HTTP request instance versus using the global `session` helper. Both methods are [testable](/docs/{{version}}/testing) via the `assertSessionHas` method which is available in all of your test cases.

<a name="enum-session-keys"></a>
#### Enum Session Keys

You may use enums as session keys. Backed enums use their value as the key, while unbacked enums use their case name:

```php
enum SessionKey: string
{
    case Cart = 'cart';
}

session()->put(SessionKey::Cart, $items);

$items = session(SessionKey::Cart);

session()->forget(SessionKey::Cart);
```

<a name="retrieving-all-session-data"></a>
#### Retrieving All Session Data

If you would like to retrieve all the data in the session, you may use the `all` method:

```php
$data = $request->session()->all();
```

<a name="retrieving-a-portion-of-the-session-data"></a>
#### Retrieving a Portion of the Session Data

The `only` and `except` methods may be used to retrieve a subset of the session data:

```php
$data = $request->session()->only(['username', 'email']);

$data = $request->session()->except(['username', 'email']);
```

<a name="determining-if-an-item-exists-in-the-session"></a>
#### Determining if an Item Exists in the Session

To determine if an item is present in the session, you may use the `has` method. The `has` method returns `true` if the item is present and is not `null`:

```php
if ($request->session()->has('users')) {
    // ...
}
```

To determine if an item is present in the session, even if its value is `null`, you may use the `exists` method:

```php
if ($request->session()->exists('users')) {
    // ...
}
```

To determine if an item is not present in the session, you may use the `missing` method. The `missing` method returns `true` if the item is not present:

```php
if ($request->session()->missing('users')) {
    // ...
}
```

<a name="storing-data"></a>
### Storing Data

To store data in the session, you will typically use the request instance's `put` method or the global `session` helper:

```php
// Via a request instance...
$request->session()->put('key', 'value');

// Via the global "session" helper...
session(['key' => 'value']);
```

<a name="pushing-to-array-session-values"></a>
#### Pushing to Array Session Values

The `push` method may be used to push a new value onto a session value that is an array. For example, if the `user.teams` key contains an array of team names, you may push a new value onto the array like so:

```php
$request->session()->push('user.teams', 'developers');
```

<a name="retrieving-deleting-an-item"></a>
#### Retrieving and Deleting an Item

The `pull` method will retrieve and delete an item from the session in a single statement:

```php
$value = $request->session()->pull('key', 'default');
```

<a name="incrementing-and-decrementing-session-values"></a>
#### Incrementing and Decrementing Session Values

If your session data contains an integer you wish to increment or decrement, you may use the `increment` and `decrement` methods:

```php
$request->session()->increment('count');

$request->session()->increment('count', $incrementBy = 2);

$request->session()->decrement('count');

$request->session()->decrement('count', $decrementBy = 2);
```

<a name="flash-data"></a>
### Flash Data

Sometimes you may wish to store items in the session for the next request. You may do so using the `flash` method. Data stored in the session using this method will be available immediately and during the subsequent HTTP request. After the subsequent HTTP request, the flashed data will be deleted. Flash data is primarily useful for short-lived status messages:

```php
$request->session()->flash('status', 'Task was successful!');
```

If you need to persist your flash data for several requests, you may use the `reflash` method, which will keep all of the flash data for an additional request. If you only need to keep specific flash data, you may use the `keep` method:

```php
$request->session()->reflash();

$request->session()->keep(['username', 'email']);
```

To persist your flash data only for the current request, you may use the `now` method:

```php
$request->session()->now('status', 'Task was successful!');
```

<a name="deleting-data"></a>
### Deleting Data

The `forget` method will remove a piece of data from the session. If you would like to remove all data from the session, you may use the `flush` method:

```php
// Forget a single key...
$request->session()->forget('name');

// Forget multiple keys...
$request->session()->forget(['name', 'status']);

$request->session()->flush();
```

<a name="regenerating-the-session-id"></a>
### Regenerating the Session ID

Regenerating the session ID is often done in order to prevent malicious users from exploiting a [session fixation](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation) attack on your application.

Hypervel automatically regenerates the session ID during authentication if you are using one of the Hypervel [application starter kits](/docs/{{version}}/starter-kits) or [Hypervel Fortify](/docs/{{version}}/fortify); however, if you need to manually regenerate the session ID, you may use the `regenerate` method:

```php
$request->session()->regenerate();
```

If you need to regenerate the session ID and remove all data from the session in a single statement, you may use the `invalidate` method:

```php
$request->session()->invalidate();
```

<a name="managing-user-sessions"></a>
## Managing User Sessions

The database driver and Redis driver with user-session tracking enabled can list and invalidate the active sessions belonging to a user. Before displaying session-management controls, you may determine whether the configured driver supports this feature:

```php
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Session;

if (Session::supportsUserSessionManagement()) {
    // ...
}
```

The `forUser` method accepts an authenticatable user, integer identifier, or string identifier. By default, Hypervel uses the currently selected authentication guard. You may also pass a guard name as the second argument without changing the selected guard:

```php
$sessions = Session::forUser($request->user())->all();

$adminSessions = Session::forUser($admin, 'admin')->all();
```

Sessions are returned newest first. Each `UserSession` contains the following values:

```php
$session->id;
$session->ipAddress;
$session->userAgent;
$session->lastActivity;
$session->expiresAt;
```

The dates are immutable `CarbonImmutable` instances. The expiration time is derived from the last activity and configured session lifetime. To determine whether a record represents the current browser session, compare its identifier with the active session identifier:

```php
$isCurrent = $session->id === $request->session()->getId();
```

You may invalidate one session, every session except a given identifier, or every session belonging to the user:

```php
$sessions = Session::forUser($request->user());

$deleted = $sessions->invalidate($sessionId);

$deletedCount = $sessions->invalidateOthers(
    $request->session()->getId()
);

$deletedCount = $sessions->invalidateAll();
```

The `invalidate` method returns `true` when an active session belonging to the user was deleted. The bulk methods return the number of active sessions deleted. If the current session is deleted, Hypervel also flushes it and generates a new session ID.

Session invalidation does not perform authentication logout. If you intend to end the current authenticated session everywhere, capture the user, log out, and then invalidate their stored sessions:

```php
$user = Auth::user();

Auth::logout();

Session::forUser($user)->invalidateAll();
```

For a Jetstream or Fortify-style “log out other browser sessions” flow, password confirmation and remember-token rotation remain authentication concerns:

```php
Auth::logoutOtherDevices($password);

Session::forUser($request->user())
    ->invalidateOthers($request->session()->getId());
```

The user associated with a session is taken from the currently selected authentication guard when the session is saved. Each session belongs to one authentication provider and user identifier. Guards that share a provider share the same user-session namespace, while different providers remain separate even when they use the same user identifiers. A custom guard without a provider may continue storing ordinary sessions, but its sessions cannot be managed through `forUser`.

In multi-tenant applications, use globally unique user identifiers for tenant-owned users and ensure your tenancy middleware validates that the authenticated user belongs to the current tenant. User-session management is account-wide and does not add a separate tenant partition.

Calling `Auth::logout()` alone does not delete the stored session. The session remains associated with its previous user until it is invalidated or expires. In addition, a remember-me cookie may authenticate the browser again during a later request and create a new tracked session.

When using Redis Cluster, the session and its user index may be stored in different hash slots and cannot be changed atomically. Hypervel updates the current owner's index before refreshing the session payload. If the index cannot be updated, the session write fails without extending the payload. When sessions are listed, Hypervel verifies each valid indexed record against the small ownership header stored with its payload. This requires one additional Redis read per valid indexed record. A write in progress may be briefly omitted from a list, but stale index entries cannot expose a session owned by another user and expire automatically.

Hypervel returns all active sessions belonging to the user and does not impose a session limit. This is intended for ordinary browser and device usage, generally tens of sessions and comfortably fewer than one thousand per user. Applications that allow automated session creation should rate-limit authentication and enforce an appropriate device or session limit.

<a name="session-cache"></a>
## Session Cache

Hypervel's session cache provides a convenient way to cache data that is scoped to an individual user session. Unlike the global application cache, session cache data is automatically isolated per session and is cleaned up when the session expires or is destroyed. The session cache supports all the familiar [Hypervel cache methods](/docs/{{version}}/cache) like `get`, `put`, `remember`, `forget`, and more, but scoped to the current session.

The session cache is perfect for storing temporary, user-specific data that you want to persist across multiple requests within the same session, but don't need to store permanently. This includes things like form data, temporary calculations, API responses, or any other ephemeral data that should be tied to a specific user's session.

You can access the session cache through the `cache` method on the session:

```php
$discount = $request->session()->cache()->get('discount');

$request->session()->cache()->put(
    'discount', 10, now()->plus(minutes: 5)
);
```

By default, session cache values are stored under the `_cache` key within the user's session data. You may change this key using the `SESSION_CACHE_KEY` environment variable or the `key` option of the `session` cache store.

These values are part of the normal session payload, not separate entries in your application's cache backend. Reading or changing them does not add a storage request; they are loaded and persisted with the session itself.

Session cache values use the session's configured serialization strategy. With the default `json` strategy, cached PHP objects do not retain their type or value across requests, so the session cache does not provide PSR-16's exact-value guarantee for objects. If you need to retrieve cached PHP objects in their original form, use PHP serialization as described in the [configuration section](#configuration).

For more information on Hypervel's cache methods, consult the [cache documentation](/docs/{{version}}/cache).

<a name="session-blocking"></a>
## Session Blocking

> [!WARNING]
> To utilize session blocking, your application must be using a cache driver that supports [atomic locks](/docs/{{version}}/cache#atomic-locks). Currently, those cache drivers include the `redis`, `database`, `file`, `swoole`, and `array` drivers. In addition, you may not use the `cookie` session driver.

By default, Hypervel allows requests using the same session to execute concurrently. So, for example, if you use a JavaScript HTTP library to make two HTTP requests to your application, they will both execute at the same time. For many applications, this is not a problem; however, session data loss can occur in a small subset of applications that make concurrent requests to two different application endpoints which both write data to the session.

To enable session blocking for every route that uses session middleware, set the `SESSION_BLOCK` environment variable to `true`. You may use `SESSION_BLOCK_STORE` to select the cache store used for locks, and `SESSION_BLOCK_LOCK_SECONDS` and `SESSION_BLOCK_WAIT_SECONDS` to change the default lock and wait times.

To mitigate this, Hypervel provides functionality that allows you to limit concurrent requests for a given session. To get started, you may simply chain the `block` method onto your route definition. In this example, an incoming request to the `/profile` endpoint would acquire a session lock. While this lock is being held, any incoming requests to the `/profile` or `/order` endpoints which share the same session ID will wait for the first request to finish executing before continuing their execution:

```php
Route::post('/profile', function () {
    // ...
})->block($lockSeconds = 10, $waitSeconds = 10);

Route::post('/order', function () {
    // ...
})->block($lockSeconds = 10, $waitSeconds = 10);
```

The `block` method accepts two optional arguments. The first argument accepted by the `block` method is the maximum number of seconds the session lock should be held for before it is released. Of course, if the request finishes executing before this time the lock will be released earlier.

The second argument accepted by the `block` method is the number of seconds a request should wait while attempting to obtain a session lock. A `Hypervel\Contracts\Cache\LockTimeoutException` will be thrown if the request is unable to obtain a session lock within the given number of seconds.

If neither of these arguments is passed, the lock will be obtained for a maximum of 10 seconds and requests will wait a maximum of 10 seconds while attempting to obtain a lock:

```php
Route::post('/profile', function () {
    // ...
})->block();
```

<a name="read-only-sessions"></a>
## Read-Only Sessions

Some routes only need to read the session, such as endpoints your frontend polls in the background while the user works in your application. Since the entire session is saved at the end of each request, a request like this can overwrite data that a concurrent request saved in the meantime, and it ages the session's flash data. To prevent this, you may chain the `readOnlySession` method onto the route definition:

```php
Route::get('/notifications/unread', function () {
    // ...
})->readOnlySession();
```

The session is started as usual, so the route can read session data and authenticate the user. However, the session is not saved when the request finishes, and neither the session cookie nor the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie is added to the response. Changes made to the session are available until the request ends, and regenerating or invalidating the session ID does not delete the stored session. The request is also not recorded as the session's previous URL.

You may also make the current request's session read-only from your route or controller using the `markAsReadOnly` method:

```php
$request->session()->markAsReadOnly();
```

<a name="configuring-the-session-cookie"></a>
## Configuring the Session Cookie

Session cookie attributes are normally configured using your application's `config/session.php` configuration file. If you need to determine session cookie attributes dynamically for each request, you may register a callback using the `configureSessionCookieUsing` method on the `StartSession` middleware.

This method should typically be called from the `boot` method of a [service provider](/docs/{{version}}/providers):

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Hypervel\Http\Request;
use Hypervel\Session\Middleware\StartSession;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        StartSession::configureSessionCookieUsing(function (Request $request, array $cookie): array {
            return array_replace($cookie, [
                'domain' => tenant()->sessionCookieDomain(),
            ]);
        });
    }
}
```

The callback receives the current request and the session cookie configuration, and should return the modified cookie configuration. This is useful when cookie attributes, such as the cookie domain, depend on the current request. In this example, `tenant()` represents an application-specific helper that returns the current tenant.

If multiple callbacks are registered, they will be executed in the order they were registered. Each callback receives the cookie configuration returned by the previous callback.

> [!NOTE]
> Session cookie callbacks persist for the lifetime of the Swoole worker. You should register them during application boot, not dynamically during a request.

<a name="adding-custom-session-drivers"></a>
## Adding Custom Session Drivers

<a name="implementing-the-driver"></a>
### Implementing the Driver

If none of the existing session drivers fit your application's needs, Hypervel makes it possible to write your own session handler. Your custom session driver should implement PHP's built-in `SessionHandlerInterface`. This interface contains just a few simple methods. A stubbed custom implementation looks like the following:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Extensions;

class CustomSessionHandler implements \SessionHandlerInterface
{
    public function open(string $savePath, string $sessionName): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function close(): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function read(string $sessionId): false|string
    {
        return '';
    }

    public function write(string $sessionId, string $data): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function destroy(string $sessionId): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function gc(int $lifetime): int
    {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Since Hypervel does not include a default directory to house your extensions, you are free to place them anywhere you like. In this example, we have created an `Extensions` directory to house the `CustomSessionHandler`.

Since the purpose of these methods is not readily understandable, here is an overview of the purpose of each method:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- The `open` method would typically be used in file based session store systems. Since Hypervel ships with a `file` session driver, you will rarely need to put anything in this method. You can simply return `true`.
- The `close` method, like the `open` method, can also usually be disregarded. For most drivers, it is not needed.
- The `read` method should return the string version of the session data associated with the given `$sessionId`. There is no need to do any serialization or other encoding when retrieving or storing session data in your driver, as Hypervel will perform the serialization for you.
- The `write` method should write the given `$data` string associated with the `$sessionId` to a persistent storage system of your choice and return `true` when the write succeeds or `false` when it fails. A failed write will cause the request to fail rather than accepting the loss of session data. Again, you should not perform any serialization - Hypervel will have already handled that for you.
- The `destroy` method should remove the data associated with the `$sessionId` from persistent storage.
- The `gc` method should destroy all session data that is older than the given `$lifetime`, which is a number of seconds. For self-expiring systems like Redis, this method may return `0`.

</div>

<a name="registering-the-driver"></a>
### Registering the Driver

Once your driver has been implemented, you are ready to register it with Hypervel. To add additional drivers to Hypervel's session backend, you may use the `extend` method provided by the `Session` [facade](/docs/{{version}}/facades). You should call the `extend` method from the `boot` method of a [service provider](/docs/{{version}}/providers). You may do this from the existing `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` or create an entirely new provider:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Extensions\CustomSessionHandler;
use Hypervel\Contracts\Foundation\Application;
use Hypervel\Support\Facades\Session;
use Hypervel\Support\ServiceProvider;

class SessionServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Session::extend('custom', function (Application $app) {
            // Return an implementation of SessionHandlerInterface...
            return new CustomSessionHandler;
        });
    }
}
```

Once the session driver has been registered, you may specify the `custom` driver as your application's session driver using the `SESSION_DRIVER` environment variable or within the application's `config/session.php` configuration file.
